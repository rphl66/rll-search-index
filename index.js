In-folio, 4 pages, papier carton: sérigraphie 1 couleur (gris clair) ; 297mm x 210 mm. The number of copies published is unknown (Endre Tót estimates a few dozen copies). Signed on the back by Endre Tót in blue pen. The layout is vertical. The front cover is titled \"nothing\" in lowercase letters. Below the title, there is a black dot. On the reverse side of the first and second panels, along their outer margins, there are two screen-printed text bands (50 mm wide and 297 mm long), where the word \"nothing\" is repeated from top to bottom. The text on the fourth page is printed horizontally. It reads:\"Budapest, May, 1971\", and further down, \"Endre Tót . Born in 1937. Sümeg, Hungary\"*. Formally, this black dot resembles the one under the title; it could indicate the author’s name. A similar use of signs as a reference to a word or a name can be found in the book Semmi Sem Semmi: Endre Tót uses the cross (x) three times to replace the word \"born\". *\"Fundamentally, two things: Endre has always been very prolific, and there are certainly dozens of these ‘printed works’ still lying around somewhere. The print run figures may be very different from those indicated. Endre might recall that ‘private editions’ or ‘personal editions’ during the communist era (which, to be clear, was a dictatorship) were, in fact, samizdat publications, whether or not they carried a political message.

Artistic creation is today, as we all know, subject to economic speculation. This means that the artist often no longer works for the sake of art itself but for personal gain. Speculation in art, especially within the unique easel painting tradition, a remnant from the Renaissance, has led many artists to seek new means of communication more frequently, in order to avoid profiteering and fashionable trends. For some years now, a kind of cultural guerrilla has been active, despite constant and harsh resistance. (Daniel Buren banned at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, Jiří Kolář refused in Prague, Freddie censored in Copenhagen, Mathelin whose two paintings were confiscated at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris, etc.). This guerrilla aims to break with the structures of the capitalist market, to place itself outside of it. The architectural, cold character of the immense geometric figures in, for example, the United States, reveals only a desire to fill space. Modern creators no longer present their works for profit, but as symbolic objects to be owned by all. When the socialization of the aesthetic function is fully accomplished – to mention just one thing – the artist will appear as a researcher enriching daily life. He then becomes the architect of leisure, of that immense, endless festival of which our life should consist. Today’s artists will not be numerous enough to create thi","tags":["1971","1972","LUND","PARIS"],"section":"/jeansellem"},{"id":"65","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/ingvar-svensson","title":"INGVAR SVENSSON | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"Show event archive Click the poster to read the press release INGVAR SVENSSON MÅLNINGAR 26.11-15.12.1971 INGVAR SVENSSONMÅLNINGAR26.11-15.12.1971 I write about Ingvar Svensson’s paintings not with any other purpose than to clarify for myself what it is I think of them: The monotonous regularity with which he executes his scenes in color fields of red, brown, orange, blue, and green — all with the same saturation, always bounded by the same dark contour — testifies to a wish to convey a meaning on a purely conceptual level. It testifies, at least, to no greater trust in “painting” than as a possibility for decorative effect. A figure with a helmet represents a soldier, another with a briefcase a civil servant, a third with a beard and red cloak Christ, etc. The figures lack individuality and acquire identity only through their attributes, as if at bottom they were the same human being, merely assigned different roles in a game between contending forces. Ultimately, it is the natural state within man, or rather human conditions, that plays out here, and its poles seem to be the demonic and the divine. When one looks at the paintings, one should attend to this drama. Yet I must admit that it is this human figure naked, stripped of attributes, that interests me most. For of course it has a face and an expression and is nothing more than the sign for a human being, plain and simple. If one disregards certain mimetic expressions of mood, one could say that the face is expressionless — painted completely flat, with eyes that seem unseeing. But this does not strike me as empty; rat","tags":["1971"],"section":"/jeansellem"},{"id":"66","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/bengt-christersson","title":"BENGT CHRISTERSSON | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"Click the poster to read the press release BENGT CHRISTERSSON MÅLNINGAR 05.11-24.11.1971 BENGT CHRISTERSSONMÅLNINGAR05.11-24.11.1971 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund BENGT CHRISTERSSON – electrographer (1942 Lund, Sweden)5–24 November 1971 The exhibition is dedicated to my mother \"Starting from two basic themes,architecture and music,I have sought to create a series of imageswhich as a whole are in harmony with these themes.\" ---------------------------------------------------- BENGT CHRISTERSSON, the fourth exhibitor at the new Galerie S:t Petri, was born in 1942 in Lund and also lives there. He calls himself an image-maker or electrographer, as he often experiments with an EEG machine at Lund Hospital. Electronic music, as practiced for example by John Cage, Bo Nilsson, Stockhausen, and Xenakis, gives him many impulses. His work is of significance for all who engage with contemporary visual art. The style, which can be called concretism, is characterized by an “anthropological quest,” in such a way that it is simultaneously an analysis and a synthesis of humanity’s relationship to the technological world. The exhibition is surely of interest to those with a philosophical orientation.

This is the first time his work is shown in Sweden. The exhibition consists of three parts, which connect the viewer with the photographs in such a way that, when experienced together, they create a geometric “sculpture.” Naturally, these “sculptures” exist only when the viewer looks at the photographs in the way Michael Crane proposes. And even then, the “sculptures” exist only intellectually, and only for as long as each viewer allows them to exist. Also presented at the exhibition is a book — “Fill in this space” — containing a collection of 26 conceptual works by Michael Crane produced during the last four years. Most of the book deals with formal and/or intuitive questions regarding things he experiences as existing around him. Michael Crane says the following:“I remain constantly puzzled and interested by the forces in the environment that affect me, as well as by my reactions to the environment and by the ways in which I incorporate these experiences.

In the situation where a strong equivalence for all forms of art prevails, there are forces which see their opportunities, mastering opinion via mass media, often ensuring that a certain political message comes through carefully constructed channels. The direction is not hard to discern; the ordinary observer can and should not seldom receive a stimulus for thought. Problematic: Form:– What is the prerequisite for the mammal’s swelling form?– Can something similar to the mammal’s form be achieved through plasma, i.e., solid matter + liquid?– Does color play any role in this context?

Some are already well known, while others are making their debut. The exhibition is not organized around a specific theme; in other words, the works are not specially created for this event. Instead, each exhibitor presents one or two works that are representative of him. The idea behind the group exhibition is that everyone—both younger and older artists, regardless of artistic direction—should be able to find a sense of fellowship in a simple, friendly, and non-institutional way, without commercial interests on the part of the gallery. Galerie S:t Petri strives to function as a miniature cultural forum, presenting various tendencies and directions within art. With Sommar Expo 72 the gallery hopes to have taken yet another step toward this goal. The exhibition runs from 2 – 21 June.

Document 1 Josef Simon, a Hungarian artist residing in Stockholm, exhibits about twenty paintings at Galerie S:t Petri between 1–20 September 1972. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, and the Beaux-Arts in Paris. Simon’s painting is deeply connected to his homeland. He is greatly interested in the music of the Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály. Kodály collected old folk melodies, but his own music, says Josef Simon, compared to these old tunes, is much more advanced, and the tones become visual color impressions. Kodály abstracts nature; through these tones Simon creates images of landscapes, which he then seeks to reproduce on his canvases. Document 2 \"I want to free you from a dogmatic perception. What is love for me may be only friendship for you. Your personal experience of my art is what matters most.

Study trips abroad followed, and in 1962 Lindgren entered the Staatliche Kunstschule in Bremen, while also participating in the Summer Exhibition of Young Art, Städtische Galerie, Munich in 1962. In 1963 he debuted with his first solo exhibition at Galerie Richter in Bremen. In 1964 Lindgren had his Swedish debut in Malmö at the Theatre Gallery with about thirty paintings. Marianne Nanne-Bråhammar then wrote about the exhibition: “The interest in light is reminiscent of a painter like Turner, today a current name. The mood in the pictures can acquire a surrealist overtone, and one understands when the artist in the catalogue speaks of a macabre world of Matta.” The following years were marked by exhibitions abroad as well as in Lund at the now existing Galerie HS and Galerie Loftet in Malmö. In 1970 Lindgren participated in the exhibition “Art for Children” at Malmö Museum.In 1970–71 he was represented in the Lunds Konsthall Artotek. In 1970 Lindgren distanced himself from official art life and began experimenting with fluorescent and phosphorescent image compositions in the long-wave ultraviolet spectrum, especially at the wavelength of 3655 Å.

One could even call it “science fiction,” except that this world is also acceptable to today’s humanity, i.e. it is humanistic in a modern sense. It is a world for man as a natural being, in which reason is ordered but where emotion and instinct also have their place. Vakily includes in his world man as an individual. He seeks to create within it a space for each human’s unique qualities. That is why he is so deeply engaged with psychology. That is why he so often paints his works “for someone.” The primordial principle of image-making, which constantly opposes the ordered, geometric, abstract, inorganic to the organic, flowing, informal, concrete, chaotic, is applied anew here, just as technology","tags":["S:T PETRI","1972","LUND"],"section":"/jeansellem"},{"id":"97","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/mats-b","title":"MATS B. | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"Click the poster to read the press release OLIVER WEERASINGHE SKULPTUR 03 - 23.09.1971 Press release (English translation) galerie s:t petri s:t petri kyrkogata 5 lund OLIVER WEERASINGHE – sculptor (1933 Colombo, Ceylon) 3 septembre – 23 septembre 1971 \"A sculpture must have its own life.

He is still a practicing psychiatrist. Schäuffelen is interested in the dual functions of words. Beyond their semantic meaning, words also have an intrinsic value as symbols.

Natural changes occur constantly, in rhythm with climate shifts and other external influences. However, human interventions in the soil cause transformations to happen faster and with far more profound effects. In Skåne, almost every square meter is marked by human activity, both in the present and in the past. Even if we are aware that major upheavals have taken place since the dawn of history, we perceive today’s exploitation of natural resources as particularly destructive. Advanced technology and a predominantly economic perspective subject the landscape to brutal treatment, both through direct interventions and through subtle, general changes. The need for nature—for our well-being, recreation, and health—is either ignored or neglected in all-too short-sighted planning. Skåne, with its extraordinarily rich and varied natural environment, is under threat, especially in its western parts, which are almost completely exploited for housing, industry, and communications. The changes are obvious and drastic. The photographs in the exhibition seek to reflect this and do so by partially contrasting the untouched with the disturbed, the beautiful with the ugly, the old with the new.

In some way, the human being has created his own likeness in the car.Nature is transformed by man into a car, which then in turn seeks to reunite itself with nature. The car lives its own life, in part quite similar to that of a human. When new, it is caressed with foaming shampoo and soft cloths, polished and admired with proud eyes. After its short service to humankind, it is perhaps removed to one of the huge car cemeteries, or abandoned in a forest clearing. There is something hopeless and beautiful about these cars, which are slowly swallowed up by nature. Grass and flowers penetrate the damaged parts, shrubbery grips the steering wheel. Car graveyards are perhaps the most expressive monuments of our time. To wander among them is like experiencing a vanished culture, while being in the midst of it. The desolation and timeless atmosphere surrounding these cars makes us unaware that this is only a generation’s work.

Thus, a museum makes a statement about something and not simply about what is immediately displayed. There is nevertheless much in recent thinking about museums which is ahistorical, attempting for so-called pedagogical reasons to divorce itself from history. Considered more deeply, the pedagogics here are highly reactionary and constitute an unsound mode of thought, however good their intentions. To contemplate without reference to history is like using a spade without a shaft. Terrible things have occurred in recent years, it seems to me, under the name of modernizing museums. The same is happening in the world of art in general, i.e. in the promotion of major international art tendencies. The real creators here are those arranging for exhibitions and it is actually their creations which are being shown. Artists whose work are chosen for the degree to which these fit into the overall picture sought by the arranger serve simply as elements. The result is one of small diverse units without historical background, so that real meaning or statement is lacking. Fluxus represented the most significant development since the War.
