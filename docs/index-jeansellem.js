Performing was the artist and poet Tom Kröjer from Helsingborg, who danced around wrapped in steel wire attached to fluttering sheets of newspaper. This was a foretaste of the “INTERNATIONAL MARGINAL MAIL-ART HAPPENING”, which “will take place in Ubbeboda during two months this autumn,” from 16 August to 16 November. The congress is organized by the Ubbeboda Center and the Drakabygget movement in collaboration with Galerie S:t Petri.The opening’s aim was to provide an introduction to and information about the activities. During the first week of August, an information exhibition and symposium will be held. The goal is to bring together a large number of contemporary artists from different parts of the world. The exhibition will also serve as a special welcome event for the Japanese professor Yoshio Nakajima, who is arriving from Japan.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:1e8c19baa8:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/18-kunstler-aus-hamburg","title":"18 KÜNSTLER AUS HAMBURG | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"18 KÜNSTLER AUS HAMBURG — HARALD FINKE FRANZ HOFER GÜNTHER HUBER MARGRIT KAHL BERND KRACKE JÜRGEN MAU BERND NABER HILKA NORDHAUSEN RALF-RAINER ODENWALD UWE PADUCK UWE POTH RENATE REIMERS HANS ROTH JOSEPH SOMOGYI MARTIN STREITENBERGER TIBOR SZEMENYEY-NAGY BEATE WASSERMANN TATJANA ZWIEZINSKY — READY MADE FROM HAMBURG 18 KÜNSTLER AUS HAMBURGHARALD FINKE FRANZ HOFER GÜNTHER HUBER MARGRIT KAHL BERND KRACKE JÜRGEN MAU BERND NABER HILKA NORDHAUSEN RALF-RAINER ODENWALD UWE PADUCK UWE POTH RENATE REIMERS HANS ROTH JOSEPH SOMOGYI MARTIN STREITENBERGER TIBOR SZEMENYEY-NAGY BEATE WASSERMANN TATJANA ZWIEZINSKYREADY MADE FROM HAMBURG29. 09.-28. 10. 1978","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:6842d71bbc:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/5-years-galerie-st-petri-1971-1976","title":"5 YEARS GALERIE S:T PETRI 1971 - 1976 | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"5 YEARS — GALERIE S:T PETRI — 03.09.1976 5 YEARSGALERIE S:T PETRI03.09.1976 On September 3, 1976, Galerie S:t Petri in Lund celebrates its fifth anniversary.Over the years, numerous activities have taken place there.Artists from many parts of the world have presented their ideas.Poets, writers, philosophers, psychologists, and many others regularly visit this small cultural center and share their experiences.(...)

At Galerie S:t Petri, the project ROUGE + BLEU No. 12 is presented — a work Albert Mertz has been developing over a period of eight years, with shorter and longer interruptions. ROUGE + BLEU is an attempt to, through the technique of painting, transcend painting itself and turn it into an expressive neutral material presence.The project consists of two identical squares placed together so that they form a rectangle — or a rectangle divided in the middle. According to Mertz, the square is the most neutral of geometric forms (there should be one large square — a small square remains a square).In the exhibition in Lund, the left square is RED, the right one BLUE.Mertz argues that red and blue are the most recent and least associative colors.Naturally, he says, like all other colors they can evoke subjective associations, but they remain RED-BLUE. Albert Mertz further states: “Red and blue contrast tonally like black and white, and chromatically like warm and cold.They work against each other and, in some cases, can flicker optically and thus cancel each other out.They can never harmonize.One therefore perceives the two squares — one red and one blue — as mutually connected, even though structurally they are distinct.Hence arises a far-reaching dissolution of pictorial meaning.With these form-and-color structures (repeated infinitely), an attempt is made to create something material that is not a sign, symbol, or expression, but pure presence.” This neutrality gives the viewer the possibility to “use” the work based on their own individual conditions rather than those of the producer. The painting shown at Galerie S:t Petri further seeks to liberate ROUGE + BLEU from pictorial form by existing as a physical presence in a fixed space — a presence that dissolves through the viewing situation itself.It is presence in a current situation and a current space that is primary. The exhibition is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 12:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9c487a0e6e:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/alexius-huber","title":"21.04 - 10.05.1972 ALEXIUS HUBER","content":"ALEXIUS HUBER — SKULPTUR RÖRELSE — 21.04 - 10.05.1972 ALEXIUS HUBERSKULPTUR RÖRELSE21.04 - 10.05.1972 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund ALEXIUS HUBER – sculptor (1939)12 – 31 May 1972 Flashing light.

Study trips abroad followed, and in 1962 Lindgren entered the Staatliche Kunstschule in Bremen, while also participating in the Summer Exhibition of Young Art, Städtische Galerie, Munich in 1962. In 1963 he debuted with his first solo exhibition at Galerie Richter in Bremen. In 1964 Lindgren had his Swedish debut in Malmö at the Theatre Gallery with about thirty paintings. Marianne Nanne-Bråhammar then wrote about the exhibition: “The interest in light is reminiscent of a painter like Turner, today a current name. The mood in the pictures can acquire a surrealist overtone, and one understands when the artist in the catalogue speaks of a macabre world of Matta.” The following years were marked by exhibitions abroad as well as in Lund at the now existing Galerie HS and Galerie Loftet in Malmö. In 1970 Lindgren participated in the exhibition “Art for Children” at Malmö Museum.In 1970–71 he was represented in the Lunds Konsthall Artotek. In 1970 Lindgren distanced himself from official art life and began experimenting with fluorescent and phosphorescent image compositions in the long-wave ultraviolet spectrum, especially at the wavelength of 3655 Å. This led to what he called “transcendental light painting”, using means deliberately chosen to evoke a third dimensional space of light, without comparison in current visual art. His light paintings can be experienced as windows in the wall leading to an inaccessible inner paradise; the paintings are static and harmonious counterparts to the acrobatic-kinetic art of the theater, created by his modern color techniques. Lindgren’s light paintings are centered on Tibetan mandalas; glowing from within, they are Dionysian night visions, dawning galaxies, light landscapes with a mystical astral character. In terms of color, they are ascetically conceived, directly de-materialized figures radiating a meditative atmosphere. These light paintings can also be likened to iconostases of “light icons” from the 19th century, captivating the viewer beyond the boundaries of language and discursive thought, into the neglected and forgotten inner-perceptual space; into the contemplative, ordered, and sacred existence of perception. These light paintings possess the lost third dimension, and here an unmistakably spiritual perspective emerges, one that cannot be confused with a merely material visual content. ALF FRITZ LINDGREN exhibits his light paintings for the first time at GALERIE S:T PETRI, LUND, from Friday 13 October – 1 November 1972.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9e7cd0d82f:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/all-time-games-alla-tiders-spel","title":"ALLA TIDERS SPEL | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"Alla tiders spel (All-Time Games ) — Saturday 02.12.1978 at 6 p.m. Alla tiders spel (All-Time Games )Saturday 02.12.1978 at 6 p.m. ABOUT GAMES….. Games are an often-overlooked part of humanity’s cultural heritage.Just as people have enjoyed a symphony or a poem for centuries, so too have generation after generation been captivated by the patterns and inherent beauty of a game. Chess originated in its original form in 5th-century India, while Go has been played unchanged for 4,000 years, and Mancala was already ancient when the pyramids were built.In archaeological records we find many examples of games: game boards for tic-tac-toe carved into the streets of Pompeii, stones, dice, and glass pieces in Viking graves.When long-ago buried kings and princes were interred with their most precious possessions, games were often included — Tutankhamun’s precious game board for playing senet is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and in the British Museum in London there is a glass cabinet containing the world’s oldest preserved game, from the royal tomb at Ur in ancient Sumer.Its age is estimated at 5,000 years. History also offers many examples, often amusing, of how important games and gaming have been.Richard the Lionheart forbade his Crusaders to play board games in order to keep their minds on more Christian matters; and over the same kind of games, Axel Oxenstierna and King Christian of Denmark once met to “settle accounts” during their negotiations in Öresund.Caesar is remembered in history for his famous dice-throw — alea iacta est, “the die is cast” — when he and his troops crossed the Rubicon to march on Rome.The emperors who followed him were not immune to gaming: Nero gambled away insane sums, Caligula was notorious for cheating, and Claudius even wrote a book about games. Playing cards came to Europe in the 13th century, probably brought back by the last returning Crusaders, and were soon banned in many places by both the Church and secular authorities. Today, games are a widespread phenomenon in both East and West — sometimes surrounded by drama: think of the casinos in Las Vegas or the latest world championship match in chess.World championships are also held in such diverse games as Monopoly and backgammon. As a modest contribution, a few members of the Swedish Game Research Institute in Lund will show parts of their collection, project some slides, and in their most charming manner, tell stories and answer questions — all for those interested — on Saturday, December 2 at 6 p.m., at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund. --------------------------------Text of the newspaper article reproduced here, translated into English. Tommy Ljungberg (left) and Dan Glimne from the Swedish Game Research Institute ponder over a modern variant of chess, \"Xyrixa.\" In the foreground are the famous Lewis pieces from the 12th century. All-Time Games Around 40 games from different eras and corners of the world are being showcased today, Saturday, at an exhibition in the Galerie S:t Petri in Lund. The exhibition is organized by the Swedish Game Research Institute in Lund, an association formed about a year ago by five guys from Lund. Saturday will be the only day of the exhibition. — We research the cultural impact of games and their social significance, explains Dan Glimne from the game research institute. Among the exhibits is the game \"Xyrixa,\" a modern variant of traditional chess. It is a three-dimensional game that exists in only four copies worldwide. — We are also displaying a copy of the world's oldest preserved chess set, the so-called Lewis pieces from the 12th century, says Dan Glimne. To acquire games for their collection, members of the game research institute travel quite a bit. Some materials are obtained through foreign newspapers and books. Games are not new in history. The British Museum in London houses the world's oldest preserved game. It is 5,000 years old and was found in the royal tomb in Ur in ancient Sumer. Chess originally comes from India in the 6th century. Archaeological records show that game boards for tic-tac-toe were carved into the cobblestones of Pompeii, and dice and glass pieces have been found in Viking graves. History can provide many examples of the significance that games and gaming have had. It is said that Axel Oxenstierna and King Christian of Denmark met over a board game to negotiate toll rights in the Öresund.At 6 PM tonight at Galerie S:t Petri, some members of the game research institute will showcase several of the games, project slides, and share stories while answering questions about the games.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9e2608e464:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/allan-bealy","title":"ALLAN BEALY | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ALLAN BEALY — SURFACES — 07.07-18.07.1975 ALLAN BEALYSURFACES07.07-18.07.1975 ALLAN BEALY (Canada) — “Surfaces” Allan Bealy from Canada is exhibiting at Galerie S:t Petri from July 7 to 18, 1975.The exhibition, titled “Surfaces”, consists of various surface materials — images and sequences that have been explored and, in this context, have acquired a broader meaning. The sawtooth motif and the parallel lines have thus become a kind of signature for the presentation of different types of paper, colors, and patterns.What is important in these works lies neither in the drawing itself nor in the surface, but rather in the somewhat metaphysical area where these surfaces become “individualized” through the signature of the drawing.They become both artworks and relics. Over the past two years, Allan Bealy has attempted, using ordinary materials (such as cardboard and plywood), to present archetypal and simple images in a fragmentary and archaeological manner, situated between representational and abstract pictorial language.He has worked with sequences, modular forms, and “open” works — meaning a fragmentary presentation, not fragmentation as such, but one that still contains the entire cosmology of the image.This should be compared with the “closed” work, which only shows details and gives hints but refrains from presenting the image in its entirety. This is the first time Allan Bealy exhibits his work independently in Europe.He has previously shown his work together with others in Italy, Switzerland, South America, and the U.S.A. The exhibition is open weekdays from 18:00 to 20:00. -------------------------------(Text from the exhibition poster.)

The drawings were made without his conscious choice. The idea is clear, the paper is chosen, the method likewise – but the creative process itself happens by itself, mechanically. It is the moment’s impulse that determines how the drawing comes into being. Andrzej Berezianski sees his hand as part of a biological machine (the body), within which reactions occur that he considers unconscious and automatic. The drawings are the result of such biologically dependent movements. These artistic “exercises,” as Andrzej Berezianski calls his works, help him to move forward in creating other images. Each time he sets out to test a new method. In this way, his experiment is never completed but is an ongoing process. Perhaps one day someone will create “the great artwork.” In the exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri, the method itself has come to the forefront. He has not previously shown this newly developed medium – the drawings acquire a four-dimensional character by using carbon paper placed between the original drawing and the copies, which are then further processed. It is an entirely new graphic method, distinct from the experimental techniques used in art during the 1970s (for example, xerox). Andrzej Berezianski has been engaged in these “artistic exercises” since 1970. He continuously generates changes in lines in an eternal process – the mutability of life itself. This is his first exhibition in Sweden.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9a25e16da5:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/andrzej-ploski","title":"LUNDIUS COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"LUNDIUS COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE — ANDRZEJ PLOSKI — SVEN-OLOF OCH PAPOU YANG LUNDIUS COMMEDIA DELL'ARTEANDRZEJ PLOSKISVEN-OLOF OCH PAPOU YANG15.12.1977 PRESS VIEWING WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1977, AT 11:00 AM PRESS RELEASE Galerie S:t Petri reopens! After more than eight months of closure, the experimental idea laboratory Galerie S:t Petri in Lund will reopen on December 15, 1977. This reopening comes as a protest against serious attempts from the Social Democratic side to suppress freedom of expression within the arts. Galerie S:t Petri had previously ended its five-and-a-half-year operation on April 6 of this year because the City of Lund considered its organizational structure did not meet the legal requirements for receiving municipal support. Although the formal obstacles were eventually removed, political resistance from the Social Democrats remained. They appealed to party discipline and loyalty, claiming that this non-commercial and non-institutional activity hardly appealed to the party’s regular voters. Above all, they felt their own groups must be protected. Galerie S:t Petri regrets being forced into a political situation. The gallery has always defended its political and religious independence. Nevertheless, no repressive stance—whether from the right or the left—can be accepted. LUNDADA BANK To secure the future of its experimental activities, Galerie S:t Petri is today, December 15, founding its own LUNDADA BANK (not recognized by civil or military authorities). The bank’s director is Jean Sellem, with honorary member Andrzej Płoski. Throughout the years, Galerie S:t Petri has often used fables and parables to describe different phases of its surroundings. Previous exhibitions have dealt with the wolf, the sheep, and the internationally acclaimed donkey shown in the gallery. The new LUNDADA BANK has now printed and will sell its own “banknotes” for the benefit of Galerie S:t Petri. The reindeer — a typically Swedish animal — appears on the note. So far, the only other species to appear in this capacity is the ten-spot ladybird. However, the bank’s board will meet this evening to decide whether other species may be considered in the future. LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte Simultaneously with the opening of the LUNDADA BANK, an intriguing comedy titled LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte will be performed at Galerie S:t Petri. The play begins on December 15 at 3 p.m. and will continue for an indefinite number of weeks. Behind the play are Andrzej Płoski (drawings), Jean Sellem (narration), and other contributors. Andrzej Płoski, from Poland, came to Sweden two years ago. During this time, he has found it nearly as difficult as Galerie S:t Petri to exist artistically. In the meantime, he has turned to tulip picking. In LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte, Andrzej Płoski’s alter ego, Sven-Olof, follows the strange adventures of the planet LUNDIUS. Płoski’s drawings depict bizarre experiences of this peculiar being on that planet — and in the surrounding landscapes of Skåne.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:f3eaaffb8e:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/ann-charlotte-sture-johannesson","title":"ANN-CHARLOTTE + STURE JOHANNESSON | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ANN-CHARLOTTE & STURE JOHANNESSON — ULRIKE MEINHOF — 09.06 - 27.06.1976 ANN-CHARLOTTE & STURE JOHANNESSONULRIKE MEINHOF09.06 - 27.06.1976 “On Germany – In Our Time” Galerie S:t Petri, Lund — 15–22 June 1976 At the Kulturhuset in Stockholm, on the morning of June 11, 1976, an exhibition by Arbetsgruppen U.M. was closed.The group consisted of the artists Sture Johannesson, Ann-Charlotte Johannesson, and the photographer Ove Hallin.The exhibition had been open for only two days. The head of Kulturhuset, Gösta Lilja, together with Stockholm’s municipal cultural committee, justified the closure as follows: “The essential content of the exhibition corresponded to a poster headline that read ‘About Germany – In Our Time’.” According to the statement on the exhibition poster, Kulturhuset was to inform constitutional institutions in the country about current tendencies in Europe such as censorship laws, professional bans (Berufsverbot), and the suppression of democratic freedoms and rights. According to Sture Johannesson, Kulturhuset’s management had already tried to censor the exhibition at its opening on Wednesday.The director denied this, claiming that it was not a matter of censorship, but of determining whether the exhibition should take place in that space at all.He maintained that there must be clear agreement between what the committee decides and what is presented. The artists behind the exhibition “On Germany – In Our Time”, whose poster text was intended to inform about political repression in West Germany, found themselves in Sweden facing another form of suppression — the denial of the right to express themselves freely in word and image. It is precisely this right to freedom of expression in art that Galerie S:t Petri in Lund now wishes to probe more deeply by taking over the exhibition from Kulturhuset and showing it there from 15–22 June 1976.With this extreme example, the gallery aims to highlight the conditions of artistic freedom in a democratic society.Are democratic rights to include such a case?What is considered taboo in political art?Clearly, this is not an incitement to violence, since such matters often appear in officially sanctioned exhibitions. The background to this exhibition, according to Sture Johannesson, lies above all in the diminished possibilities for individuals to take a stand on various issues, as a result of Paragraph 88a and several other new laws in West Germany.Paragraph 88a, along with the regulation on professional bans, reads as follows: “Anyone who offers, announces, praises, or disseminates in the country or abroad a text that encourages criminal acts, or is intended to increase the readiness of others to commit such acts, thereby endangering the existence or security of the Federal Republic of Germany, or the principles enshrined in the constitution, shall be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years or fined.” “If a person seeking public employment is a member of an organization whose activities are directed against the free democratic basic order, there is doubt as to whether he or she is prepared to defend that order at all times. Such doubt is usually sufficient grounds to reject the application for public employment.” Earlier this year, members of the West German Writers’ Union visited Sweden and other countries to appeal for collegial solidarity.The U.M. Working Group sought to give the union concrete support through this exhibition. The exhibition includes a large photograph of Ulrike Meinhof, flanked by two authentic funeral wreaths from her burial in Berlin — these were found by Sture Johannesson in a rubbish heap near the cemetery.Images from Meinhof’s arrest and funeral are shown on a television screen.There are also press clippings about Meinhof and the West German trade union, as well as stenciled excerpts from Ulrike Meinhof’s letters written during her time in solitary confinement. The exhibition is built in a conceptual form, using fragmented information that each visitor must piece together — thereby grasping the idea, the vision, and the content. Sture Johannesson emphasizes that the exhibition is not about Ulrike Meinhof as a terrorist, but rather as a cultural critic and journalist.He says that the U.M. Working Group presents the problems of oppressed and marginalized groups.He also adds that one does not have to advocate violence in order to defend Ulrike Meinhof. The exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri is open weekdays 3 p.m.–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12 p.m.–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9f52da4b5d:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/anna-banana-bill-gaglione","title":"ANNA BANANA BILL GAGLIONE | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ANNA BANANA & BILL GAGLIONE — IN A LUNDADA PERFORMANCE — DOCUMENTATION OF BANANA ACTIVITIES ANNA BANANA & BILL GAGLIONEIN A LUNDADA PERFORMANCEDOCUMENTATION OF BANANA ACTIVITIES18.11.1978 ANNA BANANA and BILL GAGLIONE from California will visit Galerie S:t Petri in Lund on Saturday, November 18, 1978 at 6 p.m. Galerie S:t Petri has long been in contact with Anna Banana, who is now on a European tour together with Bill Gaglione, and has invited her to come to Lund. Anna Banana has created her own doctrine — “Bananalogy.” She hopes eventually to publish an “Encyclopedia Bananica” that will provide information about all the different banana activities she has engaged in over the years. It all began in the city of Victoria seven years ago. Anna Banana, who was born there, proclaimed herself “Victoria’s Town Fool.” She used to dress up in various costumes and invent all kinds of fun, creative activities. She performed in streets and squares, in schools and retirement homes. At the same time, she began publishing her “Banana Rag,” which contained banana-related information of various kinds. Later she moved to California and, together with Bill Gaglione, continued producing unusual printed works. Anna Banana is a typical New Dada activist. Her performances emphasize above all playfulness. A month ago, she took part in the first intercontinental New Dada exhibition, which was shown at Galerie S:t Petri.

They are now back at Galerie S:t Petri — not in person, but through documents that provide a taste of their intense activities over the past ten years. Anna Banana has created her own discipline — bananology — and she hopes to publish an Encyclopedia Bananica in the future, in which she will inform readers about various banana-related events in her life. It all began in Victoria, Canada. Anna Banana, who was born there, proclaimed herself the Mayor of Victoria’s Fun City. She used to dress up in different costumes and invent all kinds of silly, creative activities. She performed in the streets and squares, in schools and retirement homes. At the same time, she began publishing her Banana Rag, which contained banana information of all sorts. Later she moved to California, where she and Bill Gaglione began producing eccentric publications such as Vile and File, which can be seen as parodies of the well-known magazine Life. Since the early 1970s, Anna Banana and Bill Gaglione have also been active mail artists, that is, artists whose communication with other artists and art enthusiasts around the world has mostly taken place through the postal system. They have participated in numerous mail art exhibitions worldwide. Playfulness is important for human development, according to Anna Banana. Thus, in Dada Land in California, she has organized Dada Olympics in which all participants receive diplomas in Bananology regardless of their competition results. Bananology concerns the human being who creates her own mythology by trying to step out of her “serious consumer” role and instead take part in nonsensical activities. At present, Anna Banana is fully occupied preparing for the 1980 Banana Olympics. The exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri runs until 15 February 1980, and is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 13:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ec8ea36ef6:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/anna-banana-bill-gaglione-malmo","title":"ANNA BANANA BILL GAGLIONE | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ANNA BANANA & BILL GAGLIONE — IN A LUNDADA PERFORMANCE — DOCUMENTATION OF BANANA ACTIVITIES ANNA BANANA & BILL GAGLIONEIN A LUNDADA PERFORMANCEDOCUMENTATION OF BANANA ACTIVITIES19.11.1978","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ab6ff3ffe9:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/anna-kutera","title":"ANNA KUTERA | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ANNA KUTERA — THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE NEW REALITY — 29.11 - 10.12.1975 ANNA KUTERATHE MORPHOLOGY OF THE NEW REALITY29.11 - 10.12.1975 “The Morphology of the New Reality” is the title that the Polish artist Anna Kutera has given to her exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, which takes place from November 29 to December 10, 1975. In various series of photographs, she depicts the constant metamorphoses that occur within her surroundings. Most often, we find children in the pictures. According to Anna Kutera, this is because they are always natural; they do not act — they simply are. Together with fifteen other Polish artists, Anna Kutera works with a form of art called “contextual art.”This means that art is placed in relation to time, place, situation, and the person or persons who experience the work.And since all of these components are constantly changing — while the context is never the same — contextual art represents a dynamic view of creation.The message acquires the meaning that the context allows.Its significance is not static.For this group of artists, reality is perceived as a continuous stochastic process, and they attempt to express it partly through photo series. Anna Kutera explains: “I create a semantic structure;I shape a new aesthetic in the form of chains, series, and functions,through which a semiological act arises between a sign and the interpretation of it.” This is the first time Anna Kutera exhibits individually outside Poland.She has previously participated in group exhibitions in the USA, Argentina, Belgium, England, and Yugoslavia. Anna Kutera will be present at Galerie S:t Petri on Saturday, November 29, from 14:00 to 18:00.

Exhibition open until Thursday. Here follows the last review of one of Scandinavia’s most essential galleries, S:t Petri in Lund. At the end of March, the artist Jean Sellem turns the key, and the North becomes artistically a bit poorer. “Substance in Transformation” is a duo project that has been fully realized. It is an exhibition in which the artists lead us through their own messages, of which one stands out with the greatest potential. Nature, origin, magic, tribe, cult, etc., name the syllables of communication in the exhibition’s upper layer — that layer that, through spontaneous action, also contains remnants of Denmark’s three best-known bands, Ballet Mécanique, No Knox, and Gods’ Benefits. The mythological universe of symbolic scales (and objects) can be viewed from another angle through its materials. Everything is included: straw, bark, sand, plastic, leather, pigment, wax, cardboard, paper, salt, water, flour. Several coincidences among these materials indicate a connection to age-old women’s traditions — woman as part of the practical situationist basic substance in the pattern of existence. In addition to her separate material works, Annette Lehmann and Ingela Bergehall’s exhibition, according to the description, deals with art and life. With the first tool, man was created: With this phrase, one moves further and further into the exhibition’s labyrinth, where things dissolve, and mystification arises. I do not want to waste time on a detailed account of individual elements in Substance in Transformation; instead, I concentrated on what took place in all four rooms. Here, a photographic series documents a process based on a black square canvas surface, which “becomes” active in the space. Metallic glints make it half-visible and move out over most of the floor. A consistent process has supplied the space with structures. Here (for example) we find a “historical” model for the exhibition: The Void. The dark surface and the non-linear spatial relationship underline that a gap has been created. The void, built up of cells (structures), suddenly becomes materialized. The way in which “Substance in Transformation” is built and expressed is thoroughly governed and fully conscious. But also, at some points along the edge of the heightened, neat (the “delicious effect” between dark, light, and strong colors) there is something naïve that brings forth a certain freshness. Based on what I saw, I would like to characterize A.L. & I.B.’s session as a “promising debut,” which, in short, means: completely fine, continued.

In her typically feminine world, we encounter various things that surround women. The intention is to criticize man’s dominant position in society. Through her skillful and balanced reasoning, the man seems constantly to wish to confine the woman to a role resembling that of a prisoner. This is one of the reasons why Annette Messager has not wanted to speak about her situation as a woman. Instead, she has chosen to visualize it through knitted objects, pattern cuttings, collected items, etc. Her works further reinforce the questioning of the identities imposed upon women — for example, through commercialization. Her works do not theorize about the woman, nor do they offer solutions or clarifications, but rather aim to act as a source of unease. It is as a collector that we meet Annette Messager in her first Swedish solo exhibition. Pictures and texts are assembled in notebooks entitled “The Collector Annette Messager.”The exhibition consists of three parts.The first, called “Voluntary Torture,” consists of press photographs of women treating their bodies in rather frightening ways.The second, titled “My Life in Illustrations,” includes drawings and photographs from various magazines assembled in such a way that they appear extremely personal.The third part, finally, is called “How My Friends Would Make My Portrait” and consists of a number of life-drawing sketches. Already a year ago, Annette Messager’s work was presented for the first time in Scandinavia at Galerie S:t Petri, in a group exhibition titled “Sequence.” Together with Daner Gallery in Copenhagen, Galerie S:t Petri is now finally showing her works in a solo exhibition. Annette Messager has often exhibited on the continent — among others in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and France.

Courtesy Anthony McCall. “Long Film for Ambient Light” by the English artist Anthony McCall is not a film intended to be seen on a screen.It is rather a demonstration, perceived primarily on an intellectual level. The film is presented at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, from October 4 to 15, 1975.It consists of three parts: the artist’s statement, a timetable, and a “changing” room (the windows are covered with white paper, and a lit lightbulb hangs from the middle of the ceiling).The exhibition is open from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. — from daylight through dusk to darkness.It is at this point that the relationship between the two light sources changes most (the electric light remains constantly on). “Long Film for Ambient Light” is Anthony McCall’s ninth film.It recalls his previous works in that it deals with the experience of change over time.What distinguishes it from the earlier ones is that it does not use either projector or celluloid. Anthony McCall explains: “Everything that happens — including the (electro-chemical) thought process — happens in time.A piece of paper on the wall has as much permanence as a film projector.The only difference lies in the latter’s immediate connection to our perception.” The earlier film presentations were made before a limited audience.“Long Film for Ambient Light” is McCall’s first attempt to move away from the “performance” aspect.He is more interested in exploring other basic principles such as temporality and light.For the first time, his focus is less on the physical process and more on the possibilities behind film as a conceptual activity. At the moment, Anthony McCall is participating in the Paris Biennale, where he is showing three films.Earlier this spring, he exhibited at the Malmö Konsthall inaugural show “New Media.”He has also carried out various artistic activities in England and the United States.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:52691e3fa9:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/arne-schmitz","title":"ARNE SCHMITZ | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ARNE SCHMITZ — 19.04 - 25.04.1973 ARNE SCHMITZ19.04 - 25.04.1973 Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5, Lund 046/14 78 00 Opening Thursday, 19 April 1973, 17:00–20:00ARNE SCHMITZWeekdays, 19–26 April, 15:00–20:00Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, 12:00–17:00 The landscape is not static, nor has it ever been. Natural changes occur constantly, in rhythm with climate shifts and other external influences. However, human interventions in the soil cause transformations to happen faster and with far more profound effects. In Skåne, almost every square meter is marked by human activity, both in the present and in the past. Even if we are aware that major upheavals have taken place since the dawn of history, we perceive today’s exploitation of natural resources as particularly destructive. Advanced technology and a predominantly economic perspective subject the landscape to brutal treatment, both through direct interventions and through subtle, general changes. The need for nature—for our well-being, recreation, and health—is either ignored or neglected in all-too short-sighted planning. Skåne, with its extraordinarily rich and varied natural environment, is under threat, especially in its western parts, which are almost completely exploited for housing, industry, and communications. The changes are obvious and drastic. The photographs in the exhibition seek to reflect this and do so by partially contrasting the untouched with the disturbed, the beautiful with the ugly, the old with the new. The “before-and-after” dimension can, in some cases, also be illuminating. The images, each in their own way, speak for themselves, but perhaps also pose the question: “What are we really doing to Skåne?”","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9d03c8f0fe:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/art-and-couscousism","title":"ART AND COUSCOUSISM | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"30.08.1979 — ART AND COUS-COUSISM — ACTION COUS-COUS DURING THE EXHIBITION OF NON-CLASSIFIED POST AT THE GALERIE S:T PETRI 30 AUGUST 1979 30.08.1979ART AND COUS-COUSISMACTION COUS-COUS DURING THE EXHIBITION OF NON-CLASSIFIED POST AT THE GALERIE S:T PETRI 30 AUGUST 1979 EL-HADI SIACI WAITERHAKIM MERAOU UNDER WAITERKADI MILOUDI CHIEF COOKDSAMEL TERRAK UNDERCHIEF COOK","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ad955d6c33:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/art-symposium-ubbeboda-center","title":"ART SYMPOSIUM - UBBEBODA CENTER | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ART SYMPOSIUM — UBBEBODA — 22.11 - 04.12.1974 ART SYMPOSIUMUBBEBODA22.11 - 04.12.1974 Ubeboda Center opens today, Friday, from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., with an exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund.

The positive is depicted through the sky, the clouds, and the sun;since everyone partakes in these elements, no one can take them away from us.Negative human oppression, on the other hand, is illustrated, for example,by a person locked in a gray corner of a room shouting “Faen.” Beatrice Heybroek says: “To work with art is to work for peace and against oppression.”","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:e26438ed95:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/beau-geste-press","title":"BEAU GESTE PRESS | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"BEAU GESTE PRESS — RETROSPECTIVE EXHIBITION — 05 - 17 03 1976 BEAU GESTE PRESSRETROSPECTIVE EXHIBITION 05 - 17 03 1976 Galerie S:t Petri in Lund presents from 5–17 March 1976 a retrospective exhibition about the experimental art publishing house Beau Geste Press. Over five years, numerous books, pamphlets, and objects have been published by this active edition based in England and Mexico. Now that the era of Beau Geste Press seems to be drawing to a close, its founders David Mayor and Felipe Ehrenberg are looking back on an extraordinarily intense period of publication.During the first three years, no fewer than thirty books and objects were produced, and many other works have been presented in recent years. But what most truly defines Beau Geste Press is precisely the beautiful gesture.The activity was more a philosophical way of life than an enterprise.For the most part, the publishers and artists both worked and lived together, during which time the books, pamphlets, and objects were created.The goal was to combine many different energies into a collective where intensive work was constantly taking place.The visiting artist became an integrated part of the community, and the actual works produced were episodic.What mattered was the process, the constant development, and — after a time — the diverging paths of the people involved.What remains are the books. Beau Geste Press no longer exists as a publishing house bound to a specific place.However, the special experiences gained continue within the various individuals who participated in the diverse activities of BGP.These artists are now scattered throughout the world but occasionally come together through publications that stem from the BGP spirit, even if made outside the original framework.Beau Geste Press lives on as a kind of “state of mind.” The exhibition in Lund presents books as well as photographic documents of various events surrounding Beau Geste Press.The exhibition is open weekdays 3 p.m.–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12 p.m.–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:19f41eedc1:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/bengt-af-klintberg","title":"BENGT AF KLINTBERG | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"BENGT AF KLINTBERG — Skogsdykaren (The Forest Diver) — 26.10 -6.11.1974 BENGT AF KLINTBERGSkogsdykaren (The Forest Diver)26.10 -6.11.1974 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5 — fack 7 — 22101 lund 1 — sweden — tel 046-147800 Bengt af Klintberg, who is exhibiting at Galerie S:t Petri from October 26 to November 6, has in recent years mainly been active as a folklorist.He has published the collections “Svenska trollformler” (Swedish Spells, 1965), “Svensk folkpoesi” (Swedish Folk Poetry, 1971, together with Finn Zetterholm), and “Svenska folksägner” (Swedish Folk Legends, 1972). For several years he has also taught folklore at Stockholm University. However, he began as a poet, publishing two collections of nature poetry. In 1962, he was one of the first to introduce happenings in Sweden, and during the following years he wrote several plays, including “Lidner” for Pistolteatern in Stockholm. In 1966 he published the book “Stockholmsspelet” (The Stockholm Game), which — besides poems and diary entries — contains a series of “events”, that is, pieces that can be performed both on stage and in everyday life. The concept of “event” was invented by the American George Brecht and developed mainly within an artists’ group and its branches in the USA, Europe, and Japan known as Fluxus. During 1963 and the following years, Klintberg participated in Fluxus concerts in Düsseldorf, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Oslo. Many Fluxus artists consistently refrained from producing enduring art objects and instead devoted themselves to creating actions that were art and that survived only as memories among those present — or, at most, as photographs. In a few of his own exhibitions, Klintberg transplanted Fluxus aesthetics into a Nordic environment. In April 1965, for example, he decorated a forest outside Stockholm with blocks of ice. The exhibition melted while the audience walked around and viewed it. His exhibition at S:t Petri, titled “Skogsdykaren” (The Forest Diver) — earlier shown this autumn at Fylkingen in Stockholm — consists mainly of photographic documentation of a diving suit placed in various forest environments during different seasons. --------------------------------------- The Forest Diver by Bengt af KlintbergEdition Sellem, Fack 7, 221 01 Lund 1, SwedenAutumn, 19743 dollars incl. postage Bengt af Klintberg, whose pamphlet “The Forest Diver” now appears in the Edition Sellem, is a Swedish poet and artist, who also works as a folklore scholar. He is a lecturer at the Ethnological Institution at the University of Stockholm, and he has published several well-known books on Swedish folklore, such as “Svenska trollformler” (Swedish Magic Spells), “Svensk folkpoesi” (Swedish Folk Poetry), and “Svenska folksägner” (Swedish Folk Legends). His poetry includes the books “Stigar” (Paths), “Ormkungens krona” (Crown of the Snake King), and “Stockholmsspelet” (The Stockholm Game). As an artist, he is influenced by the art theories of the Fluxus group, of which he became a member at the beginning of the sixties. He has performed happenings and events in Stockholm and other Scandinavian cities. His exhibition “The Forest Diver” has been shown in Stockholm and Lund during the Autumn of 1974.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:1287347703:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/bengt-christersson","title":"05.11-24.11.1971 BENGT CHRISTERSSON","content":"BENGT CHRISTERSSON — MÅLNINGAR — 05.11-24.11.1971 BENGT CHRISTERSSON MÅLNINGAR 05.11-24.11.1971 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund BENGT CHRISTERSSON – electrographer (1942 Lund, Sweden)5–24 November 1971 The exhibition is dedicated to my mother \"Starting from two basic themes,architecture and music,I have sought to create a series of imageswhich as a whole are in harmony with these themes.\" ---------------------------------------------------- BENGT CHRISTERSSON, the fourth exhibitor at the new Galerie S:t Petri, was born in 1942 in Lund and also lives there. He calls himself an image-maker or electrographer, as he often experiments with an EEG machine at Lund Hospital. Electronic music, as practiced for example by John Cage, Bo Nilsson, Stockhausen, and Xenakis, gives him many impulses. His work is of significance for all who engage with contemporary visual art. The style, which can be called concretism, is characterized by an “anthropological quest,” in such a way that it is simultaneously an analysis and a synthesis of humanity’s relationship to the technological world. The exhibition is surely of interest to those with a philosophical orientation.

Bertil Falk published his own comic magazine already at the age of 11. At 12, he published a short science fiction story. For a few years (1969–71) he was the editor of the Jules Verne Magazine in Sweden. This autumn, his book “Atlantis och svenskarna” (Atlantis and the Swedes) will be published. Bertil Falk has long been involved with comic magazines. During a visit to New York in 1970, he discovered that one could also collect original drawings from comic books. It is this collection that is shown at the Lund exhibition. In the exhibition catalogue, Bertil Falk writes: “The collecting of comics, original drawings, and, shortly said, everything connected with comics has gained enormous momentum in recent years. At the Star Trek Congress in New York in February 1974, more than 16,000 people gathered around science fiction and comics.Original drawings from comics can now be bought at various venues — though rarely in art galleries. At flea markets in London, from the artists themselves, sometimes through the publishers, but above all in specialized stores that have grown up in the USA and at dedicated conventions.American university libraries are now trying to complete their collections with comic magazines, and this often costs them large sums to repair previous omissions.” On Saturday, September 28, at 6 p.m., Bertil Falk will give a talk about his comic collection.

At the beginning of the 1960s, he created sculptures.Since 1965 he has been involved with the Experimental Art School in Copenhagen.Together with several friends — Joseph Beuys, Henning Christiansen, Lene Adler Petersen, Per Kirkeby, among others — he began to carry out actions in Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. The aim of these performances was to explore the relationships between different materials.Just as stone, plaster, and clay, each in themselves inert, can together form new compositions, so too religion, politics, and poetry can combine into a cultural manifestation and give rise to something meaningful. In the late 1960s, Bjørn Nørgaard began making films.His first two were purchased by the Danish State Film Board.One television film about the cultural situation in his homeland was censored, despite having been commissioned by Danish Television.Together with Lene Adler Petersen, Nørgaard has made around ten 8 mm films. The exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri is titled “Take a Cup of Coffee” (Tag en kopp kaffe).Bjørn Nørgaard writes: “At this exhibition I shall eat one of the thousands of meals I have eaten and will eat throughout my life;take a book that lies on the table, read one page, put it down again;take a pencil and write something or nothing;carry out a limited number of the indifferent actions that make up my life. I also wish to affirm order in coincidence and the principle of indifference.” On Friday, August 22, Bjørn Nørgaard will be present at the gallery.

Already at the age of ten, Bo Michanek began drawing his first film “Mårten Persson & Co.” Since then, he has completed several films, some of which have also been shown on Swedish television. No fewer than 2,000 drawings are required for a five-minute animated film! Each drawing is an extensive work in itself. First, Bo Michanek makes a sketch. Then the sketch is redrawn cleanly and colored. After that, the drawing is transferred onto transparent paper. Following this, the work on the moving figures begins. In January this year, Bo Michanek received first prize at an international festival for his film “Zoo i fantasin” (Zoo in Imagination), which is just over three minutes long.

PETRI BONDE AND CARSTENSENONE SESSIONGALERIE ST. PETRIARCHIVE OF EXPERIMENTAL AND MARGINAL ART03- 12.04.1981 CLAUS CARSTENSEN AND PETER BONDE Claus Carstensen and Peter Bonde, two young Danish artists, have for several years worked within a modernist painting tradition. However, the past year can rather be described as a year of reflection rather than action. Both reached a point in their creative process where they wanted to reduce the established meanings of things and contexts to a minimum and start anew — a kind of “zero point” art. They made a pause in their pictorial creation, but now — one year later — they are attempting, step by step, to rebuild something again. Each image fragment is added to another, and thus a scenic image grows, one that nevertheless avoids taking a qualitative stance toward the objects and their relationships. They work with well-established symbols in language but make small ironic interventions that cause the familiar symbols — the sign bearers — to appear in a different way. The definitions are no longer self-evident, and Peter Bonde and Claus Carstensen also question whether interpretation itself is inherent in things and contexts. Classical emblems such as the red flag, portraits of Gagarin, books, and slogans from demonstrations are demystified and removed from their familiar contexts, giving the material a lightly ironic tone. Peter Bonde’s slogan “Emblems reappear as goods” gives a hint that what was once believed to serve as ideals has now become something that can be consumed. That is precisely why we need to re-evaluate objects, contexts, and signs in our reality — in order not to remain trapped in thought stereotypes. The exhibition is open weekdays 3–8 p.m., Saturdays 1–5 p.m., and runs until April 12, 1981. NON-COMMERCIAL ART LABORATORY FOUNDED IN 1971.

It is a creation by the Lund rock group Bostonvärk, which during the past year has gained attention for its cross-border combinations of poetry, image, and music. During the concert at Galerie S:t Petri on January 9, Bostonvärk will also use video to visualize the music. The central figure of the exhibition is Sisyphus from the Greek myth. According to Bostonvärk, Sisyphus, who was condemned to eternally roll a stone up a hill, symbolizes the struggling artist. His movements are endlessly cyclical and are contrasted, for example, with the motorway, which is linear. Bostonvärk consists of Hasse Blomqvist, guitar; Björn Gyllix, bass; Ola Nilsson, drums; and Örjan Gerhardsson, vocals. Their LP “Bostonvärk” was released about a year and a half ago, and since then the group has toured throughout Sweden. Their next project will be a collaboration with the Claude Marchant Dance Theatre in Gothenburg to perform “The Doomed” by Stig Dagerman.

It is the first time the group performs in Sweden. Previously, they have presented their actions in Ireland, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. In their home country, the group has performed at Speaker’s Corner, in theatres, libraries, dance studios, universities, and various galleries. The restrained action characterizes most of the group’s performances. The impossibility of carrying out a simple activity without hindrance becomes evident in these performances. The obstructing factor may be either the performer themself — for instance, wrapped in ropes attempting to perform everyday tasks — or one or several other people. Tom Puckey, one of the members of Reindeer Werk, describes some of the situations one can find oneself in as follows: “With my eyes bound, I try to cut up meat and arrange the pieces in a straight line. I run around in a costume covered with sacks filled with objects, and I am in a hurry. I mark my own movements by blowing a whistle. I lie down in the street, crawl, drag myself forward. I measure the progress of a snail and follow its pace.” Tom Puckey means, in other words, that it is by no means as easy as one might think — to move, to speak, to eat, to drink, and so on. Through their actions, the members of Reindeer Werk aim to make us aware of the many mental and practical circumstances that act as brakes on our capacity for action, even in the simplest everyday situations. Reindeer Werk performs at Galerie S:t Petri on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from 3 to 8 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:a100ea7f9b:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/carstens-regild","title":"CARSTENS REGILD | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"CARSTENS REGILD — ENTERS THE BRAIN BIZZARRE — 15.10 -15.11.1976 CARSTENS REGILDENTERS THE BRAIN BIZZARRE15.10 -15.11.1976 Institute of Art History / Lund University / Galerie S:t Petri , Lund A The Human Wolf, possibly 35 years old, died yesterday after 20 years of suffering from migraine and difficulty in breathing.B The mystery of The Human Wolf began in 1953 when a conductor found an atrophied boy huddling behind the goods at a remote railway-station.C The boy was treated in the hospital, where the doctors were observing his behaviour with growing delight.D He wasn’t able to walk upright; instead he ran very fast on all fours.E He only ate fruit and raw meat and refused hysterically to take cooked food.F The boy was only able to ejaculate bestial-like sounds and when teased or frightened he bared his teeth and growled like a wolf.G During all the years of care in isolation The Wolf made very little progress.H He learnt to sleep in a fenced bed, and wore, when compelled, certain clothes but he never learnt to speak and remained terribly frightened.I The only one he ever played with was the nurse who was been assigned to caring for him.J Through all the years scientists and politicians have disputed about the mysteryical.

This is the first time he shows his work independently in Sweden. However, he has previously participated in group exhibitions at Södertälje Konsthall and Galerie S:t Petri. At the beginning of his artistic career, Boltanski sought to recover everything that had happened to him from birth to the age of six: a reading book, a lock of hair, a baby suit (1969). Later, he tried to preserve moments of his life by conserving various objects in tin boxes — thereby being able to continuously find his own existence. After a time, he realised that the reality of the past could not be revived simply by, for instance, photographing as an adult the places where he had played as a child. To rediscover his childhood, it was enough to observe other children in a given environment. Christian Boltanski’s reconstruction of his own past is fictive. Only partially do the objects — such as old photographs, invitations, postcards, or letters — stem from his real surroundings. Through his photographs, he seeks to “preserve time,” albeit in a fragmented manner. This exhibition also presents images that Boltanski has cut out from a magazine specialising in crimes and tragic events. Christian Boltanski has had numerous exhibitions in France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Argentina, and Japan, and has made films as well as a record. The exhibition is open on the opening day from 17:00 to 20:00, on weekdays from 15:00 to 20:00, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 to 17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9590f7191f:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/christian-boltanski-paul-armand-gette-hans-werner-kalkmann-annette-messager-petr-stembera-sarkis-zabunyan","title":"NEW ETER PRESENTERAR | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"CHRISTIAN BOLTANSKI, PAUL-ARMAND GETTE, HANS WERNER KALKMANN, ANNETTE MESSAGER, PETR ŠTEMBERA, SARKIS ZABUNYAN — SEKVENS — 25.08 - 05.09.1973 CHRISTIAN BOLTANSKI, PAUL-ARMAND GETTE, HANS WERNER KALKMANN, ANNETTE MESSAGER, PETR ŠTEMBERA, SARKIS ZABUNYANSEKVENS25.08 - 05.09.1973 SEKVENS sekvens – an experimental photography exhibition with six participants:Christian Boltanski, Paul-Armand Gette, Hans Werner Kalkmann, Annette Messager, Petr Stembera, Sarkis Zabunyan – all well established in avant-garde circles.

The exhibition runs from April 30 to May 14, 1976. The most significant aspect of Christiania’s culture has its origins in the youth rebellions that began in Denmark about ten years earlier. Alienation, distrust of authority, and of society as a whole were not only Danish phenomena at that time — the entire Western world experienced massive youth revolts at the end of the 1960s. In Denmark, this desire for liberation led to the creation of Christiania. “Let us try our own conditions, create with our hearts a society, a way of living together with norms, rules, faith, and all that — without having a ready-made model from the start.” This was the reasoning behind the founding of Christiania in 1970/71. In some respects, it may have succeeded; in others, it failed. But as a social experiment, the activities have certainly provided everyone — both inside and outside the area — with valuable experiences. Over the years, many activities have taken place within this “free town,” located in a former military area. Various kinds of work are carried out — in the bakery, the information office, the bathhouse, the kindergarten, etc. Several newspapers are published by Christiania. Posters and handwritten bulletins are also used as means of communication. For a while, there was even a local radio transmitter. The exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri presents reflections and thoughts from active residents of Christiania, as well as from external observers. The gallery is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 12:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:dfa89dcaee:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/christiania-1982","title":"CHRISTIANIA | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"CHRISTIANIA — 13.02-21.02.1982 CHRISTIANIA13.02-21.02.1982 Unknown photographer","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:f5ded52a44:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/christmas-eve-with-poetry","title":"CHRISTMAS EVE WITH POETRY | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"CHRISTMAS EVE — WITH POETRY — 23.12.1974 CHRISTMAS EVEWITH POETRY23.12.1974 Christmas Eve with Poetry at Gallery S:t Petri LUND: On Christmas Eve, Gallery S:t Petri invites you to a poetry program, \"The Earth Trembles from the Foolish...\".

For some time, new music had already been combined with various art forms as well as with non-artistic fields.However, the musicians found these interdisciplinary efforts insufficient.Instead, they wanted to subordinate the original artistic activities and emphasize non-artistic objectives. At the Volterra psychiatric hospital, improvised “open music” met with a number of patients in an open-ward setting.Later, these music sessions came to be held in a large hall at the hospital, where anyone who wished could participate in the event. These activities were not intended as music therapy in the usual sense but should rather be seen as an attempt to use improvised music to create a group-dynamic situation, exploring possible avenues for artistic expression within a repressive context. The results of these experiments can be experienced at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, on Saturday and Sunday, 9–10 October 1976, from 6 to 8 p.m.Recordings from the various musical sessions, as well as sound tapes, will be presented.In addition, two series of photographs will be shown — images of moments and situations that arose through the interaction between new music and new psychiatry. Albert Mayr studied music in Italy and Germany.During the 1960s, he worked with Pietro Grossi in the field of “programmed music.”In the early 1970s, he visited Canada and lectured at McGill University.Various musical developments took place during his four years of residence there.At present, Albert Mayr is a teacher of electronic music at the Conservatory in Florence.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:cba18f6e7a:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/contextual-art","title":"CONTEXTUAL ART | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"CONTEXTUAL ART — EXHIBITION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY UNIVERSITY BUILDING, 3RD FLOOR.

In addition to these two exhibitions, Galerie S:t Petri is organizing a conference on contextual art at Malmö Konsthall on Monday, 9 February at 6:45 p.m., including lectures, discussions, film screenings, and video presentations. It is the first time that this group gathers for an exhibition based on a manifesto of contextual art, developed by art historian and theoretician Jan Świdziński.According to Świdziński, the ideas of this form of art emerged at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s through conversations among various artists — mainly those who met around Galeria Recent Art in Wrocław, Remont Gallery in Warsaw, and the Workshop of Film Form in Łódź.The artists discussed various problems within art and felt that conceptual art — “idea art” — had reached its end. According to Świdziński, something stronger had to grow out of it; it was time to move forward.He therefore worked both theoretically and practically to formulate a new program, which we can now take part in in Lund and Malmö. In previous years, the group organized two symposia on experimental art in Warsaw and Gdańsk. Several theoretical discussions also took place. Using contemporary media — photography, film, video — these contextual artists shape reality.Jan Świdziński states: “It is the context, the situation, that determines what is art.It is the situation that tells us what art is.” Contextual Art","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:c8be2d4deb:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/coum","title":"COUM | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"COUM TRANSMISSIONS — 11 - 25.01.1978 COUM TRANSMISSIONS11 - 25.01.1978","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:216509dad5:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/cres","title":"CRES | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"CRES — JOHAN CORNELISSEN, PETER MERTENS, JAN NEDERVEEN , ROB NYPELS — 09.05 - 22.05.1981 CRESJOHAN CORNELISSEN, PETER MERTENS, JAN NEDERVEEN , ROB NYPELS09.05 - 22.05.1981 The exhibition took place from 9 to 22 May 1981, with a performance by Rob Nypels on 15 May, followed by a performance by Johan Cornelissen on 16 May. Below: 1. Press release of the exhibition 2. Press release for Rob Nypels’ performance 3. Press release for Johan Cornelissen’s performance 1. Exhibition Press Release Cres – a Dutch artists' group consisting of Johan Cornelissen, Peter Mertens, Jan Nederveen, and Rob Nypels, presents documents from their collaboration with the experimental magazine Cres, which they started in 1978. The group dissolved and the magazine ceased in 1980. During this period they developed a very close relationship, which also meant that they carried out performances together. The magazine work involved a conscious focus on the collective working process: decision-making, the selection of artists who were given the opportunity to create an issue of Cres. The group also worked with printing and layout of the magazine. To a large extent they paid for the publication themselves. To explore more deeply the meaning of the collective working method, its positive and negative aspects, self-awareness, reciprocity between the group members in a specific situation, in a particular environment, has been a shared artistic goal for the four during this two-year period. The exploration of what arises through such intense close contact between different people could be expressed in many ways – for example in an experiment that three of them carried out in 1979. They lived and worked together for four weeks in a gallery and at the same time performed performances concerning relationships and communication between people – happening in a limited area during that time. For some time now they have mainly worked individually. At Galerie S:t Petri two of them have arrived – Johan Cornelissen and Rob Nypels. On Friday 15 May and Saturday 16 May at 20:00 they will present their performances. The two have different personality temperaments – one more analytical, the other more emotional – although of course they are both/and. Objects, human beings, the inner and outer of communication, calm and unrest, closeness and distance are simultaneously present in the situation here and now. With the help of sound, voices, photographs, body movements, they attempt to visualise how natural and culturally created phenomena exist side by side simultaneously – both inside and outside the human being. The exhibition is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays 13:00–17:00. It runs from 9 to 22 May 1981. 2. Performance Press Release — Rob Nypels (15 May 1981) ROB NYPELS from Holland sees himself as a permanent re-searcher of his surroundings or éspace ambiant. He arrived at Lund recently and knows nothing about either the town or its inhabitants. He is curious and wants to meet people here. Therefore, on Friday May 15th at 8.00 p.m. he invites those living in and around Lund to come to Galerie S:t Petri, where he will present his project more in detail. One could say already that his main interest is communication in a broad sense, the artist and the audience meeting for mutual give and take. Rob Nypels endeavors to understand phenomena in their totality – the relationships between human beings, between objects, and between human beings and objects. He feels one should always be ready to develop one's consciousness at any moment. Lund, Sweden in May, 1981 3. Performance Press Release — Johan Cornelissen (16 May 1981) Maps of Sweden and of Lund are of major importance to the Dutch artist JOHAN CORNELISSEN in his performance to be held at Galerie S:t Petri on May 16th, 1981 at 8.00 p.m. With the help of these abstract representations of the country and the town he tries to capture their natural and cultural characteristics and transform these into artistic language. In every object, human being and event there exist at any given time both naturally and culturally created phenomena which a person has to balance in such a way that the one aspect does not suppress the other. At the same time each new phase of development in an object, human being or event also involves the destruction of something else, thereby maintaining a balance. Accordingly, a tree appearing in a landscape contains the possibility of being cut down and thus transformed into another form. Johan Cornelissen visualizes this by placing two amplifiers on a tree, these transmitting from a tape-recorder the sound of a power-saw, thereby allowing a person standing next to the tree to experience the simultaneousness of the tree’s two possible states of being. He wants the perceiver to transcend the concrete material aspect, helping him or her to picture the hidden forms in what appears to be a clearly defined and closed entity. However, Johan Cornelissen is also questioning whether, and why it seems to be, that every constructive development in anything also means the destruction of some element, and that life in a sense is also dead. The map of Sweden indicates forest to be a special characteristic of the country. For this reason, Johan Cornelissen selected two relatively isolated spots near Lund to represent Sweden and Lund as well as the philosophy that new forms emanate from old perpetually. One person will be standing before a particular tree at the one spot listening to the sound of a power-saw on tape. A second person, placed at the other spot, which represents a tree cut down and transformed into a pole of an electric power line, will be listening to the sound of an alarm signal. A third individual will be located at Galerie S:t Petri, where drawings of the two other spots will be hanging and where the sounds played at both places will be heard. Visitors to the gallery participate in the process of trying to go beyond the visually given signs and of imagining the circumstances at the other two places so as to capture the multidimensionality of the situation.Marie Sjöberg, Lund, Sweden in May, 1981.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:70ab68c50c:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/dick-higgins","title":"DICK HIGGINS | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"DICK HIGGINS — 30.8-11.9.1974 DICK HIGGINS30.8-11.9.1974","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:df9763e30b:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/dikt-for-dig","title":"DIKT FÖR DIG | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"DIKT FÖR DIG — FALL 73 TO SPRING 74 DIKT FÖR DIGFALL 73 TO SPRING 74 Poets!This autumn Galerie S:t Petri is starting a new activity and offers you the opportunity to make your poems public in the gallery’s windows.

Until 1962, Huebler was a painter. His geometric paintings then became reliefs, followed by modular wooden constructions.These were usually white, block-like, open units placed directly on the floor.Each part could be experienced from any direction — there was no “right” side.With these minimal sculptures, Huebler sought to establish a complex sculptural idea in the viewer’s mind. The next logical and radical step came in 1967, when he began to work with non-object-based activities, which he still does.With words, maps, diagrams, and photographs, he documents real places around the world — so far apart that they cannot be experienced directly.Thus, the sculptural ideas exist only as analogies in the mind of the person who perceives the material — the conceptual form that art takes. Huebler’s works contain little intrinsic meaning; they are not built on any special psychological, sociological, or philosophical foundation.The information is suggested through analogies; it is never directly stated.The works are carefully structured so that the viewer must complete the meaning. Douglas Huebler defines art as an activity that expands human consciousness through constructions that transform natural phenomena — from the qualitatively undifferentiated state we call “life” — into objective and inwardly focused concepts.The conceptual systems Huebler uses are random or logical series of temporal aspects or linguistic propositions, and their external form is documented through photographs, taken with a camera used as a recording device, without the photographer making any aesthetic decisions. Douglas Huebler has held numerous exhibitions around the world, but this is his first solo exhibition in Sweden. Galerie S:t Petri is open weekdays 3 p.m.–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12 p.m.–5 p.m. ----------------------------------------Text printed on the poster Douglas Huebler — Artist Statement I would define art as an activity that extends human consciousness through constructs that transpose natural phenomena from that qualitatively undifferentiated condition that we call \"life\" into objective and internally focused concepts.Since Impressionism most art has been based on an inference that our experience of natural phenomena necessarily calls for its transposition into visual manifestations. My work is concerned with determining the form of art when the role traditionally played by visual experience is mitigated or eliminated.In a number of works I have done so by first bringing \"appearance\" into the foreground of the piece and then suspending the visual experience of it by having it actually function as a document that exists to serve as a structural part of a conceptual system.The systems used are random or logical sets of numbers, aspects of time, or propositions in language, and the \"documents\" of appearance are photographs that have been made with the camera used as a duplicating device whose operator makes no \"aesthetic\" decisions. Whatever is visual in the work exists arbitrarily and its real existence remains as itself — in \"life\" along with everything else — and separate from art or the purposes of art.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:7cca670929:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/ds-art","title":"DS ART | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"DS ART — INSTRUKTION EARTHPIECE.

EXHIBITION PRESS RELEASE DS ART was founded in 1979 in Gothenburg. The driving forces behind this multi-media collective are Mikael von Hauswolff, Tjell Zakrisson and Malgorzata Kubiak. Around them there are another 12–13 people who devote themselves to music, theatre, poetry, pantomime, street theatre, etc. A space in Haga – “Last Aeroplane II”, now the DS ART Gallery – is the centre of their activities. DS ART is based above all on friendship among people. DS ART attempts to broaden the concept of art into a many-sided creative and existential activity in which all means and forms of expression are permissible. Among them are jugglers, fire-eaters, dancers. Many use a kind of ritual painting on the face and body. Often their forms of expression give an impression of secrecy. The designation DS is also secret. At Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, a photo exhibition by Kari Jantzen and Erik Pauser is presented. They have documented DS ART’s activities. For the exhibition at S:t Petri a special piece of music has also been created. A form of earth-art is also presented – Earthpiece One – consisting of a package containing a secret object. Soil was then placed over the package. After the exhibition the package will be buried in the hole that was dug and the soil will be replaced over it, without the package ever being opened. The exhibition begins on 26 June and continues until 4 July 1981. It is open weekdays 15–20, Saturdays 13–17. 2. TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE EXHIBITION POSTER INSTRUKTION EARTHPIECE.ONE.

The idea for the exhibition was developed at the international symposium for experimental art – F Art 75 – held in Gdańsk, Poland, at the beginning of September.Jean Sellem, director of Galerie S:t Petri, participated in the symposium along with Endre Tót, and together they decided to quickly organize a manifestation in Sweden, as Tót had not previously exhibited his work there. Since the early 1970s, Endre Tót has been working with zeros.On postcards, posters, newspapers, xerox copies, and other materials, he draws his eternal zeros and, from the post office in Budapest, sends out his information to the whole world.In this way, messages such as “I am glad if I can type zeros” or “I am glad if I can write with my left hand” find their way into circulation. This method of communication has allowed him to quickly and easily connect with people all over the world.Through his zero-activities, Endre Tót gives, in his own characteristic way, an image of the circumstances under which he lives.As Tót expresses it: “I am glad if I can type zeros” and “Nothing ain’t nothing”. Endre Tót has previously exhibited in Austria, Switzerland, France, England, the USA, and Canada.He has even issued his own zero-stamps.

He makes use of the gallery’s special architecture, drawing lines and writing sentences directly on the walls and windows. The exhibition is called “Gladness Drawings and Writings”, and it truly reflects Endre Tót’s life-affirming philosophical attitude. Almost ten years ago, Tót taught apprentices in printing in Budapest and got the idea to start working with sentences and what could be a more reasonable starting point than to feel and express gladness in such printed meaning. Since, for example, in Hungary one generally cannot print just anything without the censorship’s approval, this seemingly harmless experiment became quite controversial and risky for both himself and his students. The artwork read something like: “I am glad I could print this meaning.” The joy of being able to express oneself has since come to shape Endre Tót’s artistic approach. Image and word follow each other in his work. The text is perhaps the most important — it is the one that clarifies the idea. The text need not only be written on paper; it manifests visually in various ways: on banners, on buildings, or — as in Galerie S:t Petri — directly on walls and windows. In his small room in Budapest, Endre Tót began to express his “gladness” sentences in the simplest way. He wrote zero-texts, such as “I am glad if I can type zeros,” and sent his “gladness” letters, cards, and posters to friends all over the world. These various postal events later came to be shown at the Paris Biennial in 1971. That was the beginning of an art movement called Mail Art, in which experimental artists worldwide began to engage from then on. Endre Tót’s “gladness” sentences also have a philosophical background. The circumstances under which he has lived have created a kind of pessimism, yet they have not been able to suppress his joy of life. The sentences are filled with irony and humor, yet at the same time carry an undertone of profound seriousness. His message is clear and distinct, but expressed in a subtly ironic way. The playfulness is evident: one may even laugh at his seemingly naïve expressions of joy, yet at the same time grasp their depth. At present, Endre Tót holds a working grant in West Berlin, where he will remain for another six months. He is regarded as one of the most important experimental artists of the 1970s in Eastern Europe. This is his first personal visit to Sweden, although he had already exhibited at Galerie S:t Petri in 1975. On Saturday at 6 p.m., Endre Tót will present his exhibition.

About two years ago, Erlingur Ingvarsson completed his art studies in Reykjavík and, like several other Icelandic artists before him, went to Amsterdam to absorb the Dutch cultural climate. More recently, he has been working at the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf. A poetic undertone permeates his work. Despite having tried during his stay in Holland and Germany to break free from the dependency on language, he has come to realize that one cannot easily cast off centuries of Icelandic literary tradition. Instead, he seeks to weave this heritage into a contemporary language — a language of images and visual poetry. In Perpendiculars I–V, Erlingur Ingvarsson presents ideas primarily dealing with time — how an idea develops, changes, is interrupted, and reinterpreted. What matters is not so much the idea as a fixed form, structure, or entity, but rather the new interpretative possibilities that the ideas themselves open up and through which he seeks to communicate with us. An idea breaks off, turns at a right angle, and continues along new paths, which can be endlessly reinterpreted. It is often such moments of interruption that determine when an idea suddenly feels insufficient and must be broken off, transformed, or viewed from another angle. In life, we are given a limited number of cards — with certain given possibilities — yet instead of stagnating, even a single possibility can offer a new perspective. There is never only one way to see; there are infinitely many. Through his Perpendiculars, Erlingur Ingvarsson leads us through such variations of interpretation — variations of ideas over time. This is his first solo exhibition. Perpendicular I will be performed on Wednesday, April 23 at 6 p.m. The remaining performances will follow on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, also at 6 p.m. Galerie S:t Petri, Archive of Experimental and Marginal Art, Box 1507, 221 01 Lund, Sweden.

Some are already well known, while others are making their debut. The exhibition is not organized around a specific theme; in other words, the works are not specially created for this event. Instead, each exhibitor presents one or two works that are representative of him. The idea behind the group exhibition is that everyone—both younger and older artists, regardless of artistic direction—should be able to find a sense of fellowship in a simple, friendly, and non-institutional way, without commercial interests on the part of the gallery. Galerie S:t Petri strives to function as a miniature cultural forum, presenting various tendencies and directions within art. With Sommar Expo 72 the gallery hopes to have taken yet another step toward this goal. The exhibition runs from 2 – 21 June.

The real theme of the series is the emotional reaction this documentation of an everyday reality produces - a reality which everyone hopes to escape but which almost everyone experiences sooner or later. One's first impression is characterized by fear and uneasiness or by a kind of dissociation, but this is followed by an understanding of the cool objectivity and the high level of science and professional ability found in this reality. There is also a feeling of hope and expectation - that the examination proves there is no real danger, or that treatment is finished and convalescence and rehabilitation have started. But more important, I think, is the fact that the pictures reflect the inexplicable, the relentlessness of causality (or destiny). Certain persons at certain moments may be afflicted and unintentionally taken into a closed world where all everyday problems disappear and everything is concentrated on elementary, existential problems and questions. This is a world characterized by great distance between the sterile and technologically perfect apparatus and the personal experience of disease and treatment. It is a world full of insecurity, pain and fear, but also of hope, primitive joy - and grim humour. There is an indispensable but secret solidarity between the patient, the nurse and the doctor, just as there are enormous barriers between them. The language, the behaviour and the instruments used by the doctor seem incomprehensible, mysterious and ritualistic, the ideas of the patient also being characterized by superstition, fetishism and taboos. For anyone who is not yet a patient, the fear of disease (of pain and annihilation) often creates a similar superstition and results in more or less reasonable individual measures to escape or postpone disease. More effective prevention might be achieved, of course, if prophylactic measures were instituted in society as a whole, but such rational thoughts are weak when pitted against the mythology connected with disease and the struggle against disease.

For example, the bomb shelter substitutes for the house or apartment. In the U.S., during the McCarthy era and in the middle of the cold war, the atomic shelter was commercialized and could be built for a few thousand dollars, in the garden, cellar or backyard of the house. They are hermetic structures made of concrete with the capacity for an average family featuring air conditioning, food storage, etc. Many of them can still be found, used as playing rooms for the kids equipped with ping-pong tables and similar things.One of the most significant spaces in martial architecture is the bunker, a fixed defense cell of reduced dimensions with the capacity for two or more men depending whether it is a machine gun post or an artillery post. You always find the bunker generally isolated, despite its being part of a larger defense complex. In this fixed cell, watching and waiting become the companions of a crew obliged to use such a space as a home, during prolonged periods of time.When the biggest worry is self-protection, one doesn’t have the time to feel oneself.After a certain time of living in the same place, one observes and discovers the spots and chips on the wall and ceiling. Little by little one discovers faces, animals, which after being fixed in your mind will never abandon the place that belongs to each one of them. Sometimes you will give names to them, but not indiscriminately: only to the ones which have seized one part of the life of the discoverer.For the person inside, the basic function of the bunker is to protect the physical and psychological integrity of the person inside. The occupant needs to think that he is in a position of advantage and the bunker offers him this belief just by its appearance, although this is not necessarily true. The subject’s unconscious responds to this with confidence; the bunker isEven in the worst circumstances it is sad to abandon the space where we lived, the corner where we ate and slept, the wall over which somebody wrote a name or a sentence “Here lived Felipe Torrado. 10/8/38”one of the architectural spaces which is most closely related to the maternal womb in subjective terms through its protection of the individual against the exterior hostility which has to be confronted alone.One of the many things the bunker hides is its own weakness. It also hides the fear of the men inside, the tedium and the ways of fighting it, some of them difficult to justify to theMasturbating is one way of making sure that you are still alive, that you can still generate manufacturers of customs, if they would follow beyond the wall that produce them. Logistically, that you still have a sensitive body.

It all will depend on how we take the being attacked by flame-throwers forcing the soldiers inside to jump out, in flames like torcontext we are living in.ches: the luckiest of them being killed in euthanasia by the enemy.Despite everything, the bunker, this shelter of female nature when it appears in dreams, seems inexpugnable when looking at it straight, from the distance.Every act of violence has a sexual equivalent.

The exhibition, which takes place from 28 September to 6 October 1976, consists of three parts, two of which were created as a reaction to her first personal encounter with the classical cultural heritage.After returning to Canada from a year-long stay in Italy in the early 1970s, Françoise Sullivan wanted to clarify for herself the “meaning of art.”“So many different means exist,” she says, “to express the original in art.” Françoise Sullivan’s medium this time became photography.In the first section, we see ten small photographs of the artist walking through an area of Montréal filled with oil refineries.The text accompanying the photographs reflects her slightly disillusioned thoughts about contemporary art.As she walks through this ugly industrial landscape, she recalls Hegel’s words about the classical period: “Nothing can be truer or more beautiful.” But despite the ugliness, one must still play in life, says Françoise Sullivan.In another series of walks, she takes the Greek god Apollo as her companion.Thus, the unpleasant surroundings become less striking — Apollo represents for her beauty and strength. The third section of this exhibition consists of material made for a major event in the summer of 1976, when the cultural section of the Olympic Games invited eighty artists to decorate Montréal’s main boulevard, Sherbrooke Street.However, the city’s mayor, Jean Drapeau, found the artworks unsatisfactory and ordered them to be bulldozed down.Within a week, Montréal’s residents were able to see the artists’ works, but despite protests — including from Québec’s Minister of Culture — the pieces were never restored. Françoise Sullivan’s work, “Legends of Artists,” included photographs, texts, and articles about important artists and writers who had lived on Sherbrooke Street during different eras.An excerpt from this large document is shown in the third section of the exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri. Françoise Sullivan has previously exhibited her works in Scandinavia, as well as in France, Italy, Belgium, South America, and Canada.

At the same time as a square meter of art is for sale in Le Monde, Galerie S:t Petri in Lund is presenting a retrospective collection of documents covering the previous works of this media artist. Until around 1970, Fred Forest worked as a painter and press illustrator in Algeria and France, with numerous exhibitions to his name.Thereafter, he began working in the field of Sociological Art (Art Sociologique).His experimental working methods use mass media (press, radio, TV), telephone, video, and more.His activities differ from traditional artistic criteria — his methods are rather scientific. For several years, Fred Forest has carried out a number of experiments with various newspapers in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Argentina, and Brazil.The first took place in Le Monde in January 1972 and consisted of an empty square of 150 cm², where readers were invited to express themselves in that space, thus initiating a dialogue.He performed a similar communication experiment two years ago in Sydsvenska Dagbladet in connection with his participation in the exhibition New Media at Malmö Konsthall.Another time, he organized a one-minute period of image and sound silence on television, inviting viewers to describe their thoughts during that minute — he received 250 responses. Fred Forest’s main interest concerns communication between people — whether verbal or non-verbal.In his many video recordings, one can follow his “investigations” of the various gestures of people in different roles, professions, and social groups. At Galerie S:t Petri, visitors can see a selection of short presentations of his various activities.The material mainly consists of texts in A4 format.

Two and a half years ago, Fukiko Nakabayashi exhibited her life drawings in lead pencil for the first time in Sweden, at Galerie S:t Petri.Equally important as the works on the wall was the \"void\" that arose between the viewer and the image.According to the artist, this void is filled with life and should be seen as a part of a harmonious whole. For some time now, she has incorporated stones into her visual world.Just as life itself has a multi-layered, perhaps multimillion-year history, so too does the stone have a heart that makes possible emotion, love, and spirituality — it contains a deep mysticism.In the exhibition, the continuity between things in nature and between human beings and nature is revealed through thin pencil lines.A stone is filled with life lines, and suddenly a line extends from this stone to another, then to a third, and so on. Fukiko Nakabayashi wants us to realize that some form of magnetic abstraction is what gives life to the “space” between things, between people, between things and people.The abstract connecting link is as present as that which it connects.

Contributing largely to the introduction of experimental and marginal art in Sweden, the Gallery aimed to be a forum where the exhibitions would reflect the new tendencies of international art, while also being open to other activities such as music, literature, and debates.More than 500 artists from all over the world have presented their ideas and works there, as well as writers, philosophers, and psychologists. A meeting space for people of varied interests, everyone comes freely to discuss in a friendly atmosphere — to share or confront different conceptions, artistic expressions, and life experiences.Nothing is bought or sold there, and the Gallery also holds a rare archive collection on modern art. In April 1977, the Gallery was about to close its activities, having been refused by the municipality a subsidy request of 15,000 Krs, corresponding to the annual rent of its premises, submitted through the Ars Libera Foundation.Despite much support and the intervention of university professors, the motion of the Communist Party (Vpk), and the statement by the president of the municipal council Sverker Oredsson (Fp) emphasizing the Gallery’s role in cultural life, the social-demokrater followed a voting directive against the proposal — even though some of their members, acting on personal responsibility, declared they rejected the request.Discipline and loyalty to the party are the two pillars of the social-demokrati! In the newspaper S.d.S. of September 27, Birger Rehn, a social-demokrat, declared: “There are other activities which I consider more important. During the preparation of the budget, for example, we spent 25,000 Krs to engage the free artistic groups increasingly in our work.” It was already known — though not yet here! — that only realist art is considered sacred… After Lubomyr Molnyk’s protest during his concert at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, denouncing the cultural policy of the social-demokrati, the Gallery reopened for a large happening on December 15, the day of the municipal session that was to decide again on the matter. For this occasion, it created its own Lundadabank, issuing a new currency printed on the model of the dollar and called ræn, one ræn worth 10 Kre (10 F).In Swedish, the word ræn means both “clean” (ræn pengar = clean money) and “reindeer,” a typical Scandinavian animal.Also note that Mr Birger Rehn, social-demokrat… Under the slogan En för alla, alla för ræn (“One for all, all for one… reindeer”), and amid a cascade of puns, this “reindeer currency” was accompanied by an exhibition of the satirical book Lundius: Commedia dell’arte, remarkably illustrated by the Polish artist Andrzej Płoski, with a text by Jean Sellem, recounting the misadventures of a poor emigrant artist in the land of reindeer. The sharpness of the irony had an effect: that very evening, the municipal council finally granted the subsidy for 1978.A center of cultural life and innovation, the Gallery — ideally located opposite the busy municipal library — resumed its activities with a presentation of underground photographs from England.

After eleven years, the gallery has not been able to solve its primary problem of survival. The main difficulty, apart from the gallery’s operating costs, has always been the fixed rent. This year these amount to approximately 40,000 kronor. Despite an annual contribution of 15,000 kronor from the City of Lund and income of 30,000 kronor from the support association Galerie S:t Petri’s Friends, there remains a deficit of 30,000 kronor for 1982. This situation will soon force the gallery to close unless the City of Lund radically changes its distribution of responsibilities. The politicians’ argument for not granting appropriate support is based on a prejudiced comparison with the activities of the Free Groups in the city. Galerie S:t Petri’s activity cannot be compared with that of the Free Groups. In its character, the gallery is closer to the country’s other art institutions — a free institution, within which, among others, the Free Groups may also appear. The closure of Galerie S:t Petri is, from a political, economic, and cultural standpoint, indefensible in a university city such as Lund. As the person responsible for Galerie S:t Petri, I would very much like to meet with you, in your capacity as representative, to find a constructive solution, and ask you to inform me of a suitable time. With best regards, Alternative version The Galerie S:t Petri in Lund is a laboratory for ideas and art, politically and religiously independent. The gallery was founded in 1971 with the main purpose of presenting new forms of expression in the visual arts — performance art, conceptual art, post-art, and other art forms that find it difficult to gain visibility within institutional and commercial contexts. In this way, the gallery — strictly non-commercial — has been able to show the Swedish public innovative tendencies and new developments in art from different parts of the world. In all cases, these are phenomena of great importance for activities related to the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. The gallery therefore regularly organizes evenings, lectures, and debates on artistic and cultural issues. Since January 1, 1978, the gallery’s activities have received a grant of 15,000 SEK per year from the municipality of Lund. However, the annual rent for 1982 amounts to 33,000 SEK, plus about 7,000 SEK in additional expenses. Through membership in the foundation “Galerie S:t Petri’s Friends,” anyone wishing to support the gallery’s aims can help ensure the survival of this independent, non-commercial meeting place. Membership can be obtained by visiting the gallery in person (S:t Petri Kyrkogata 5, Mon–Fri 15:00–20:00, Sat 13:00–17:00), or by paying the annual membership fee (100 SEK) to postal account 7 81 58 – 3. Additional contributions are, of course, gratefully received!","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:fea4ecb9e9:page","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/genesis","title":"GENESIS | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"GENESIS #block-550d908b3397578cd67f { --sqs-block-content-flex: 0; } /* =========================== Footer \"VISIT ALSO\" (boutons) =========================== */ .rll-visit-footer{ padding:24px 0 32px; text-align:center; } .rll-visit-buttons{ display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; justify-content:center; gap:10px; } /* Boutons stylisés (pas de logos) */ .rll-visit-footer .rll-footer-btn{ display:inline-flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; padding:1px 9px; border-radius:4px; font-family:\"Overpass\", system-ui, sans-serif; font-weight:500; font-size:10px; line-height:1.1; letter-spacing:.14em; text-transform:uppercase; border:1px solid #111; background:#f7f7f7; color:#111; text-decoration:none; } /* Bouton \"VISIT ALSO\" (même look, non cliquable) */ .rll-visit-footer .rll-footer-label{ pointer-events:none; cursor:default; } .rll-visit-footer .rll-footer-btn:hover{ background:#111; color:#f7f7f7; } .rll-footer-label .rll-footer-arrow{ font-size: 18px; margin-left: 0.35em; } /* Style spécifique du bouton VISIT ALSO */ .rll-visit-footer .rll-footer-btn.rll-footer-label{ background: #55838d; border-color: #55838d; color: #f7f7f7; } /* (facultatif) hover un peu plus sombre */ .rll-visit-footer .rll-footer-btn.rll-footer-label:hover{ background: #426772; border-color: #426772; } @media (max-width:600px){ .rll-visit-footer{ padding:1px 0 9px; } } document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function(){ var container = document.getElementById(\"rll-visit-buttons\"); if (!container) return; var path = window.location.pathname || \"/\"; var isJeansellem = path.indexOf(\"/jeansellem\") === 0; var isTot = path.indexOf(\"/endre-tot-editions\") === 0; var isMain = !isJeansellem && !isTot; // Bouton \"VISIT ALSO\" identique visuellement var label = '<span class=\"rll-footer-btn rll-footer-label\">VISIT ALSO <span class=\"rll-footer-arrow\">➡︎</span></span>'; // Bouton AbeBooks réutilisable var abeBooksBtn = '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=0&vci=61142469\">ABEBOOKS</a>'; var html = \"\"; // Domaine principal if (isMain){ html = label + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem\">' + 'GALERIE S:T PETRI ARCHIVE</a>' + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/endre-tot-editions\">' + 'ENDRE TÓT EDITIONS</a>' + abeBooksBtn; } // Section JEANSELLEM else if (isJeansellem){ html = label + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com\">' + 'RAPHAËL LÉONARD LEVY</a>' + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/endre-tot-editions\">' + 'ENDRE TÓT EDITIONS</a>' + abeBooksBtn; } // Section ENDRE TÓT EDITIONS else if (isTot){ html = label + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com\">' + 'RAPHAËL LÉONARD LEVY</a>' + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem\">' + 'GALERIE S:T PETRI ARCHIVE</a>' + abeBooksBtn; } // Fallback (au cas où) else{ html = label + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem\">' + 'GALERIE S:T PETRI ARCHIVE</a>' + '<a class=\"rll-footer-btn\" href=\"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/endre-tot-editions\">' + 'ENDRE TÓT EDITIONS</a>' + abeBooksBtn; } container.innerHTML = html; });","tags":["page","jeansellem"],"section":"page"},{"id":"u:0ee98a9a18:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/gert-glentow-valdemar-wentz","title":"GERT GLENTOW AND VALDEMAR WENTZ | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"GERT GLENTOW — VALDEMAR WENTZ — EVENTIDE GERT GLENTOWVALDEMAR WENTZEVENTIDE19 - 27.03.1977 Eventide — Toward Evening is the title of the next exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund.Valdemar Wentz, photographer, and Gert Glentow, poet, both from Lund, have brought together poems and photographs which, in part, describe the same darkly contemplative state of mind. The image suggests what the text continues to express, or vice versa. It is not a matter of one illustrating the other, but rather of an encounter between the two in the realm of twilight — both literal and symbolic. In the images and texts, Valdemar Wentz and Gert Glentow offer a point of departure for associations — a foundation that belongs to the dusk, where experiences of fear and tragedy emerge quietly but clearly. In the pictures, one glimpses Vibia, the doll with a cracked skull, conveying an impression of lifelessness. The name actually originates from a martyr who died in Carthage in the 3rd century. Valdemar Wentz and Gert Glentow have not exhibited together before. The former has had numerous exhibitions behind him, both solo and in group shows. The latter has published the poetry collection To Almost See – To Almost Feel, and has contributed to several anthologies.

Only then does interest in his work and personality spread, when researchers begin to study the papers and photographs he has left behind. I don’t want that to happen to me.”So instead, he has chosen to collect and present the important events of his life himself. In the first catalogue he compiled, we find photographs from his childhood, his parents, and his siblings. Pope Pius XII’s blessing telegram for his wedding day is also included, as well as images from his military service. At the end of these historical documents about himself, there is a costume he wore while writing his autobiography. There is also an excerpt of what is assumed to be written about him in the World Encyclopaedia. In the next catalogue Cavellini published about himself, we can read twenty-five letters to the world’s most prominent figures throughout history, in which they thank him for the attention he has shown by dedicating his book about them.Here, Cavellini is placed within his “proper historical context.”The first letter is dated 469 B.C. and addressed to Homer. The Evangelist John receives one as well, as do Leonardo da Vinci (1506), Shakespeare, Marx, and Darwin.The final letter is sent to Mao Tse-Tung. In his latest catalogue, Cavellini compares himself with the great artist personalities of the 20th century, demonstrating—through carefully composed photographs—similarities in physiognomy, in their way of posing, and in how they look at their wives. The exhibition by and about Cavellini at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund is an exemplary and thorough study of how one can create a myth of oneself during one’s own lifetime. The exhibition opens on March 29 and runs until April 6, 1977.It is open weekdays from 15:00 to 20:00, and Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 to 17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:c163ac06f5:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/hans-nordenstrom","title":"HANS NORDENSTRÓM | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"HANS NORDENSTRÓM — BRUL — 26.04-08.05.1974 HANS NORDENSTRÓMBRUL26.04-08.05.1974 HANS NORDENSTRÖM exhibits at Galerie S:t Petri from 26 April to 8 May 1974** Under the signature BRUL, architect Hans Nordenström made his debut in 1961 with small, humorous drawings of little characters. According to the artist himself, these drawings deal, at their deepest level, with anxiety and inadequacy. The man who always fails is his hero. His life story is, outwardly, comic, but at the same time touches something tragic within us. The little stumbling figure with his everyman face is a complex double-nature, which emerges through humorous forms. In the early 1960s, the book “A Box of Magic, or 118 Funny Stories” was published, in which Hans Nordenström appears in a small section titled “The Comedian and the Audience.” There he writes:“Perhaps you still dislike me. But now you are my adversaries, and I extend my long nose to you — resurrected for artistic purposes.” Besides drawing comics, Hans Nordenström often and gladly works with animated film. He is also a Doctor of Technology. During the exhibition, his film “Man in Nature – Man in Culture” will be shown.In the 1950s he was also the publisher of around ten issues of Blandaren, released by the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where contributors included, among others, Pontus Hultén and Per Olof Ultvedt. The exhibition will be presented at 6 PM on opening day by Professor Oscar Reuterswärd.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:53ed4727dc:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/hardy-strid","title":"HARDY STRID | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"HARDY STRID — LE CRIME PARFAIT — 06-15.07.1981 HARDY STRIDLE CRIME PARFAIT06-15.07.1981 At Galerie S:t Petri in Lund a large amount of circumstantial material has been gathered concerning The Perfect Crime. It is HARDY STRID from Halmstad who lets the exhibition visitors play detective, discover an intrigue or try to figure out what kind of crime has been committed. Among the clues we find a boxing glove, a Mona Lisa puzzle, a milk tooth and an issue of The Village Voice, New York 1973. Hardy Strid, who turns 60 on 6 July, was one of the first in Sweden to engage in Dadaism and conceptual art. For just over four decades he has been active as an artist, both in Sweden and abroad. Throughout his artistic career he has tried to create continuity between countless different isms, artistic styles and various cultural traditions. He studied at Valand in Gothenburg 1948–52 under Endre Nemes. Over the years he has collaborated with, among others, Jörgen Nash and Jens Jørgen Thorsen and other artists in and around Drakabygget. Hardy Strid’s art is strongly influenced by the Second World War. A lost Europe, an apocalyptic tone, existential expressions are prominent in his works. But playfulness has not disappeared. He has taken part in many happenings. And at S:t Petri, visitors can take part in an exciting art-thriller – The Perfect Crime. The exhibition begins on 6 July and continues until 15 July 1981. It is open weekdays 15–20, Saturdays 13–17.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:7051801a3c:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/helmut-vakil","title":"03-22.11.1972 HELMUT VAKILY","content":"HELMUT VAKILY — TECKNINGAR MANUELLA MULTIPLER — 03-22.11.1972 HELMUT VAKILYTECKNINGAR MANUELLA MULTIPLER03-22.11.1972 Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5Lund046 / 14 78 00 Between November 3 and 22, Helmut Vakily from Munich is showing about thirty drawings and manual multiples at Galerie S:t Petri. It is the first time this German-Persian artist is exhibiting in Sweden. Raised in Tehran during the first ten years of his childhood, he came to Germany in 1949 and has lived there ever since. Since 1963, he has had several solo exhibitions in Germany and has also participated in group exhibitions both nationally and internationally. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5Lund046 / 14 78 00 HELMUT VAKILY3 – 22 November 1972 Vakily’s “Beautiful New World” is a dream, a utopia. One could even call it “science fiction,” except that this world is also acceptable to today’s humanity, i.e. it is humanistic in a modern sense. It is a world for man as a natural being, in which reason is ordered but where emotion and instinct also have their place. Vakily includes in his world man as an individual. He seeks to create within it a space for each human’s unique qualities. That is why he is so deeply engaged with psychology. That is why he so often paints his works “for someone.” The primordial principle of image-making, which constantly opposes the ordered, geometric, abstract, inorganic to the organic, flowing, informal, concrete, chaotic, is applied anew here, just as technology is set against the natural. It is only that contrast which Vakily considers insufficient as merely a complement. In Vakily’s work, time is an essential component. We experience a connection or confrontation between different realms: between the interior and outer space, between the world and eternity. The feeling of time can also be experienced in the small scenes that are depicted side by side or beneath one another, showing the movement of time within an age, shaped by Einstein, who understood time as a dimension of space. This seems natural to us. Our century’s art, which began with Cubism, has shown us that this dimension can be expressed through artistic means. For him, time is not a measurable or ordered element, but has a differentiating and rhythmizing function. On the contrary, for Vakily, time is a flowing element, which encompasses and unites everything: humanity with eternity, the microcosm with the macrocosm. It is not only man who enters the painting, but man who stands before the painting — the viewer. Thus the question of art is not only an image of existing reality. Often that is certainly the case. But just as often man creates in art a world of his own dreams, a better world, which in reality does not exist and perhaps cannot be realized. In this way, the world of art can help man to meditate and reflect: upon the world and upon himself. But the world of art can also give man the courage to take a stand, towards a world transformed. In this sense, Vakily’s “Beautiful New World” becomes more than merely an illusion or dream — it can be a source of inspiration. Vakily’s approach is very personal, not especially tied to trends or fashion. This could even be seen as anachronistic. Yet I am convinced that in today’s multifaceted art, his is a voice that should not go unheard.

According to Henrik Have, who founded the edition at the beginning of the 1970s, Edition After Hand is more of a concept than a publishing house.The goal was first and foremost to publish books and objects (multiples) by Have himself.However, editions by other artists, such as the American Ken Friedman, have also been produced.A magazine of the same name as the publishing house has recently been launched and has published six issues so far. Henrik Have describes Edition After Hand as follows: “It has become apparent in the work with writing and image (not least in the aftermath of the May 1968 revolt in Paris) that the definition of a state can no longer be said to be about the difference or independence of things, but rather about the process itself — which contains the invisibility of things. The only form that exists is the private one (outside of and with others – it exists nowhere else); the only possible recognisable publicness. Edition After Hand is the schizophrenia between the private and the public.Schizophrenic because there are no boundaries between these states.Schizophrenic because the states of political struggle are defined in order to create linguistic and social proof of the absence of one of these states. Edition After Hand has arisen out of these states. You are beautiful, and what you say explains nothing, but is the process: you are beautiful. Edition After Hand is a process — not a goal.” The exhibition is open on weekdays 15:00–20:00,and on Saturdays and Sundays 12:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:47ce6d1319:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/henrik-pryds-beck-tom-krojer","title":"HENRIK PRYDS BECK TOM KRØJER | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"22.08.1978 — DU, DA DA PERFORMANCE BY YOU NOW — THE AUDIENCE: 22.08.1978DU, DA DA PERFORMANCE BY YOU NOWTHE AUDIENCE:HENRIK PRYDS BECK & TOM KRØJER","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:1d9a3f2478:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/herve-fischer","title":"HERVE FISCHER | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"HERVE FISCHER — ART ET COMMUNICATION MARGINALE — TAMPONS D'ARTISTES 14-26.03.1975HERVE FISCHERART ET COMMUNICATION MARGINALETAMPONS D'ARTISTES SOCIOLOGICAL ART group Hervé FISCHER, Fred FOREST, Jean-Paul THENOT have decided to set up a SOCIOLOGICAL ART group which will be able to serve as a liaison and working structure for all whose research and practical work in the field of art has the sociological phenomena and the link between art and society as its fundamental theme. The SOCIOLOGICAL ART group notes the manifestation of a new awareness of the sociological facts, linked to the process of massification. The domain of this awareness is now no longer the relationship between man as an individual and the world, but the relationship between man and society which produces him. By its artistic activity, the group expects to subject art to reexamination, to reveal the sociological facts and to enable visualisation of a sociological theory of art. Though it will resort primarily to the theories and methodology of the social sciences, it also hopes that this artistic activity will provide opportunities for research and experiment. The group is aware of the diverse ideological views of the publics. It will use intercommunication, surveys and interrogative teaching. At the same time it relates art to its sociological context, and draws attention to the new channels of communication, which appear to be radically new features in the evolution of art, and demand new ways of working.

THE JOURNEY LASTED FOR 28 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES.29.09 - 13.10.1979 On May 30, 1979, at 11 a.m., a remarkable artistic journey began from Divion to Tourcoing in northern France. The 20-year-old Hervé Lesieur sent himself as a sculpture in a box by truck to an art school at the destination. The trip lasted 28 hours and 45 minutes. He explains his experiment as follows: “My joy is great, since I can use my body in physical performances (performance art), even though I feel fear of being isolated, shut in a box measuring 2 m x 1.20 m. It feels challenging to arrange an experiment in living conditions similar to those to which astronauts are subjected, to test how my body functions in a confined space, to expose myself to certain danger caused by lack of air or similar.” The journey was documented in photographs and with Hervé Lesieur’s own texts. This material is shown at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund until October 11, 1979. Some of the results he reported after the journey were, among others, that the box was too small — he could not lie down at all; the box was not sufficiently sealed — it was impossible to use the flashlight because the light would have revealed him; and the ventilation was good. Paul-Armand Gette writes in his introduction to the exhibition that Hervé Lesieur has paid particular attention to two specific aspects of the artist’s activity — namely packaging and transport. Between the artist and the exhibition there lies precisely the work of packaging and dispatch. This experiment therefore focuses on those forgotten moments that precede and make possible the establishment of an exhibition.

It testifies, at least, to no greater trust in “painting” than as a possibility for decorative effect. A figure with a helmet represents a soldier, another with a briefcase a civil servant, a third with a beard and red cloak Christ, etc. The figures lack individuality and acquire identity only through their attributes, as if at bottom they were the same human being, merely assigned different roles in a game between contending forces. Ultimately, it is the natural state within man, or rather human conditions, that plays out here, and its poles seem to be the demonic and the divine. When one looks at the paintings, one should attend to this drama. Yet I must admit that it is this human figure naked, stripped of attributes, that interests me most. For of course it has a face and an expression and is nothing more than the sign for a human being, plain and simple. If one disregards certain mimetic expressions of mood, one could say that the face is expressionless — painted completely flat, with eyes that seem unseeing. But this does not strike me as empty; rather, it is overflowing with emotion, with a feeling that does not know its path and is therefore at once helpless and relentlessly pressing forward. In a few small paintings of naked human beings — a child crawling on a sloping plane, a woman making a gesture of fear — the fundamental experience seems to find expression, and characteristically enough, they allow no gap to appear between form and content.

After SUM, which played a significant role in the development of experimental art during the 1960s and 1970s both at home and abroad, contact continued with Gallery Sudurgata 7, and now a completely new generation of artists can be seen emerging — a new avant-garde is in the process of developing. The six Icelanders presenting their ideas at Galerie S:t Petri from 14–28 March 1981 have all studied under Jan Van Eyck Academie in Maastricht, Holland, over the past few years. They belong to the first generation of artists educated at the new, experimentally oriented art academy in Reykjavík. Some of the former SUM members initiated this line of work, and for a year now, both older and younger generations of experimental artists have been collaborating within the newly founded Living Art Museum in Reykjavík. \"Inside-Out Art\" is a completely new phenomenon in contemporary art. The term was coined by Galerie S:t Petri and refers to the six exhibitors’ attempts to visualize the innermost essence of human beings or objects. Thus, for instance, a tube or a ball’s interior has been formed into delicate plaster fragments that fill these objects’ inner space. What usually cannot be seen here takes on a tangible form. What happens within a person’s thought world remains private as long as it is not communicated. Every action thus becomes an attempt to let the inner speak to the outer, so that the surroundings can understand that wholeness consists of both the inner and the outer. The exhibited works express a desire to move beyond dualistic thinking — that is, the separation between black and white, life and death, the inner and the outer. A candle in a vase allows us to experience both the inner and the outer simultaneously. Everything is essentially one, although our perceptual capacity does not allow us to see both sides at the same time. Fantasy and intuition are essential to develop if we are to experience multidimensionality in existence. This is the first time that \"Inside-Out Art\" is presented. The artists are: Sólveig Adalsteinsdóttir, Ingólfur Arnarsson, Magnús V. Gudlaugsson, Thór Elis Pálsson, Eggert Pétursson, and Guðrún Hrönn Ragnarsdóttir.

The event opens on 1 September 1978. Around one hundred and fifty works by approximately one hundred and fifty artists from North and South America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Eastern and Western Europe fill the gallery’s five exhibition rooms. Dadaism, which saw its dawn about sixty years ago, had as one of its aims to provoke its surroundings. By showing at exhibitions objects that were not usually associated with art, the Dadaists wanted to question the fixed norms of what was considered art and non-art. Marcel Duchamp was the leading figure within classical Dadaism. The New Dadaists take things one step further than their predecessors. It is no longer merely about “shocking” their environment, but rather about making people aware of themselves and giving individuals the courage to create. Their premise is that every human being is creative. It is in North America, especially the U.S.A., that Neo-Dadaist ideas are primarily found. However, it is not as easy now as it was sixty years ago to point to a clearly defined geographic or political area. Different media have made human individual problems global. These artistic expressions often occur at the margins of society. In Eastern Europe, artists struggle with ideologies; in Western Europe, with commercialism. Klaus Groh, in his doctoral dissertation (1977), thoroughly examined the various forms of Neo-Dadaism that have emerged in North America. He also emphasizes its pedagogical significance. Groh believes that the artist’s most important task is to give other people the courage to create and reshape their own lives. Art as a creative challenge, rather than as an object, is his and the Neo-Dadaists’ guiding principle. The material presented at Galerie S:t Petri therefore consists not of “finished” works of art but primarily of mental impulses directed at the viewer. The viewer thus always becomes a co-creator — if he or she is open to it. One of the participants, Leif Eriksson, has placed grass mats in the gallery windows. On Friday (1 September) and Saturday (2 September) at 6 p.m., Klaus Groh himself will be present with various surprise events. Professor Oscar Reuterswärd from the Faculty of Art History, who assisted in realizing the exhibition, will give a lecture on Dadaism.

This is the first time he is showing his photographs outside his home country.At the gallery, two photographic series are presented: “Passion – Desire – Flying” and “Self-Exposure.”István Szirányi says of the first series that the three chosen concepts have been arranged and examined as consequences of one another.They contain, he believes, roughly the same emotional tension.He compares his way of working with methods used in perception-psychological research.The words expressed immediately before the exhibition itself evoke different reactions and preferences among the viewers.The specific concept leads each individual into a particular train of thought, and the reaction can sometimes be read directly from the person’s face — a kind of movement or perhaps a complete stillness.Szirányi began with analytical studies of himself.During the photographic process, one observes many faces, and through deep analysis, one should, he believes, be able to gain insight into one’s own self and perhaps create a possibility for change.The images of different faces — of himself, his mother, a friend, etc. — help him to compile and develop earlier experiences.He can see himself in relation to these different people over a certain period, in a particular context.The experiment shown at Galerie S:t Petri is not yet concluded.In “Self-Exposure”, Szirányi covers his face with a camera, which becomes the transmitter of the image.He compares the role of the camera with the plaster material used when making a cast of a face.In both cases, it is the face itself that serves as the means for an artistic composition — through the use of lips, tongue, teeth, and facial muscles.The exhibition is open weekdays 3 p.m.–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12 p.m.–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:d0390b5de8:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jacek-tylicki","title":"JACEK TYLICKI | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JACEK TYLICKI — LIVING IN THE TREE — 18 - 29.10.1979 JACEK TYLICKILIVING IN THE TREE18 - 29.10.1979 A chestnut tree in southern Lund has been involved in an experiment carried out by the Polish artist Jacek Tylicki during the night between August 31 and September 1. He spent 18 hours in a hammock up in the tree. It is about wanting to test the body’s ability to withstand stress, to defy the natural elements. Alpinism and solo sailing also fascinate him. The idea of wanting to live in the tree emerged while Jacek Tylicki was engaged in another project in which the same chestnut tree was also included. Since January 1 this year, he has been photographing the tree every day between 1 and 2 p.m. He intends to continue doing so until January 1, 1980, when the cyclical process comes to an end. The purpose is to attempt to visualize the passage of time through a series of images, to experience time visually, to directly observe change. In the picture series, one notices how differently each day appears. Everything is unique, unrepeatable. There is constant change. Jacek Tylicki would also like to try living in the tree for a longer period together with a few other people, to see how humans cope with such a situation; how the relationships between the people would develop. At Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, color photographs are shown from the experiment in the chestnut tree as well as the changes it has undergone since January. The exhibition runs from October 18–29, 1979.

OLD MEDIA 1, as the exhibition in Lund is called, describes in an impersonal way the situation in the Konsthall and at the dinner table on the opening day — what people did, their attitudes, and expressions. Jacques Charlier has long been engaged in this kind of factual documentation.Many times, banal and trivial human encounters are taken out of their usual context and placed within an artistic framework.In this way, he can highlight a particular event, activity, or situation at a specific place and time. For years, Jacques Charlier has worked at a government office in Liège, where he has often photographically documented certain events — for example, retirements, conferences, and parties.These series of images have since been exhibited in various places across Europe. The photographic technique has enabled him to isolate single occurrences from their surroundings, make them visible, and set them against one another. Jacques Charlier’s perhaps somewhat monotonous image series, once one becomes accustomed to them, often raise the question of the value of life.

The title refers to the logic of possibilities and necessities — the so-called modal logic or many-valued logic — which emerged at the beginning of the century.This modern logic, unlike classical logic, does not deal with concepts of true and false but rather emphasizes the many possible values.Expressions such as almost, more or less, perhaps, possibly, neither…nor are all connected with this attitude toward reality. Jarosław Kozłowski is not a logician, but he uses logic in his creative process.Like art itself, logic is a construction of thought, performed by human beings in their attempt to grasp existence.To be an artist, Kozłowski emphasizes, is a particular way of existing, and artistic creation is one of several possible ways of relating to reality. According to Kozłowski, human beings possess numerous potential possibilities, some of which they realize during their lifetime while abandoning others.Awareness of these different possibilities depends on self-confidence and self-understanding.Through this awareness, one can come to perceive them through different modes of action.Creation is thus a way of acting. Kozłowski conceives art as an unlimited number of rational constructions — as a universe within thought, as a neutral reality independent of context, non-deterministic yet governed by certain rules.Both systems — art and logic — are merely two among countless possible thought-constructions that humanity has devised to grasp reality.We can never compare them directly to reality itself, since they are constructions. At the exhibition in Lund, Jarosław Kozłowski presents a model for ethics and a model for aesthetics.Those interested in discussing his work are welcome to Galerie S:t Petri on Saturday, 15 January, at 6 p.m. The exhibition is open weekdays from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 12 noon to 5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9230dd42aa:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jaroslaw-kozlowski-1979","title":"JAROSŁAW KOZŁOWSKI | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JAROSŁAW KOZŁOWSKI — WALL SCULPTURES V-IX GALERIE S:T PETRI LUND — 17.12.1979 - 02.01.1980 JAROSŁAW KOZŁOWSKIWALL SCULPTURES V-IX GALERIE S:T PETRI LUND17.12.1979 - 02.01.1980 Jaroslaw Kozlowski from Poland visits Galerie S:t Petri in Lund from December 17, 1979 – January 2, 1980. It has been three years since he first came to Sweden and Galerie S:t Petri to present his logical art works called “Modalities”, which emphasized the many value possibilities — terms which almost, perhaps more or less, are associated with an attitude toward reality rather than with concepts of true or false. For a long time there were various logical texts and reflections in Jaroslaw Kozlowski’s visual art, but in recent years he has primarily devoted himself to purely visual structures. At present, he is interested in walls. A wall is different from any other, and if one pays attention, one can discover much along the way. Last year, Jaroslaw Kozlowski was asked to paint several people’s apartments — just like any professional painter would. He made color samples and the tenant chose the color himself. Then he painted the walls in the chosen color and at the same time kept the sample as documentation of the many “wall paintings.” These Wall Paintings have since been exhibited throughout Europe. At Galerie S:t Petri, we can see wall sculptures V–IX. These sculptures are the facts of the walls themselves; it is the walls that speak with some assistance from the artist. He chooses how large the sculptures should be by cutting larger or smaller openings in the wall. The five sculptures are also associated with the following words: sometimes, someone, somewhere, somehow, something. The exhibition is open weekdays from 3–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 1–5 p.m.---------------------------------(excerpt from a letter by the artist sent to Marie Sjöberg and Jean Sellem) Poznań, 31.12.1979 Dear Jean, dear Marie, once more thank you for nice time in Lund.

He is one of the first to have published visual poetry.Works by various avant-garde poets were gathered in his anthology “Once Again”, published in the USA in 1968.He has collaborated with numerous magazines over the years, notably in the USA, Japan, and Italy. Since 1967, Jean-François Bory has published about ten books.These are created mainly using scissors and glue.For him, what matters in a book is not the ideas it expresses (which could just as easily be conveyed through speech or painting), but the book itself.What makes it a book and nothing else is the collaboration between the author, proofreader, typographer, printer, bookbinder, and the finished result that takes shape through Bory’s own work.He transfers the text into the object, which then begins to live its own typographic life. Thus, “Letter to My Mother” depicts a sinking warship loaded with the letters of the alphabet.Letters can also undergo a strange mutation and become inedible mushrooms (“Rotten Poetry”).“Literature” shows a tank rolling over parts of the alphabet. Language — as represented through letters, words, sentences, writing, written sheets, and the book — is Jean-François Bory’s working material.In his visual poetry, he seeks a balance between verbal motifs and visual figures. Jean-François Bory writes: “To begin from the beginning is to travel across the black river of writing,to cross thousands of signs,high and dark waves of sentences,and, without remembering,one day wake up on the other side,far from everything, far from everything,for everything is forever beyond time.” Jean-François Bory has previously exhibited his works in France, Italy, England, Holland, and the USA.This is the first time he is exhibiting in Scandinavia.

Jean Le Gac presents only isolated texts and displays the photographs in such a way that they seem like precious memorials devoted to revealing something whose meaning has been lost.The original activity within the text and photograph seems hidden: it becomes a myth, a mystery.The meaning of these messages always remains unfinished.What matters, however, is the way in which they conceal a possible reality. Jean Le Gac’s work is an exploration of the subjective relations that each of us maintains with the real world.He illuminates the mechanisms that govern our subjective experience of things — how memory and imagination affect our contact with our surroundings.For Jean Le Gac, objectivity does not exist. Since 1969, Jean Le Gac has been working with narratives accompanied by photographs.It is his intention to try to unite visual and linguistic mysticism.This combination of image and text has in recent years increasingly attracted the attention of certain experimental artists. Jean Le Gac has presented his works in France, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Israel, and the USA.In March, his works will be seen at Malmö Konsthall in a group exhibition called “New Media.” The exhibition is open on weekdays from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., and on Saturdays and Sundays from 12 noon to 5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:823b998d43:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jean-paul-thenot","title":"JEAN-PAUL THENOT | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JEAN-PAUL THENOT — 100 READINGS OF MARCEL DUCHAMP — 02 -16.04.1980 JEAN-PAUL THENOT 100 READINGS OF MARCEL DUCHAMP 02 -16.04.1980 Tribute to the Unknown Artists Over the course of several weeks beginning on March 31, 1981, the kitchen of Galerie S:t Petri will be transformed into an office.

At present, a large exhibition titled “Tecken, bokstäver, skrift” (“Signs, letters, writing”) is being held at Malmö Konsthall. It is organized by Roberto Altmann, the previous exhibitor at Galerie S:t Petri. When an artist like Jean Roualdès from Paris communicates with people, it takes the form of an SOS message. As early as 1969, Roualdès started his “signal series,” which he has since sent out periodically. With this series, he has participated in exhibitions around the world.An SOS signal can be transmitted simultaneously in up to 165 places in different parts of the world. Thus, a global communication is created. Already in 1973, Galerie S:t Petri in Lund transmitted SOS signals consisting of sound and light.Now Jean Roualdès returns with an exhibition in which documents from various SOS activities will be presented. However, the exhibition is not only about sound and light signals, but also about human perception of a signal — our ability to retain its image, and the extent to which fatigue influences that ability.In a certain sense, it could be said that Roualdès is testing our visual and auditory attention. The exhibition takes place from April 4 to 11, 1978, and is open on weekdays from 15:00 to 20:00, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 13:00 to 17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:72ff46d5a3:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jean-topazzini","title":"JEAN TOPAZZINI | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JEAN TOPAZZINI — JOHNY BRAVO ROCK'N ROLL STAR — 1-2.12.1976 JEAN TOPAZZINI JOHNY BRAVO ROCK'N ROLL STAR 1-2.12.1976","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:6ccd1c7910:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jeff-ibbo","title":"JEFF IBBO | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JEFF IBBO — 25.05 - 06.06.1973 JEFF IBBO25.05 - 06.06.1973 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund046 / 14 78 00 The erotically playful woman has always interested the painter and draftsman Jeff Ibbo, who is exhibiting at Galerie S:t Petri from May 25 to June 6, 1973.In about fifteen paintings, he presents to us his vision of woman. His art can be described as erotic: men and women, alone and together, are transformed, dissolved, and reach states of erotic joy and pleasure. By twisting and reshaping the figures, Ibbo says he achieves a stronger physical relationship to things than if he merely rendered them through emotional observation. Ibbo is influenced by Pop Art and comic drawing. Small events in a person’s existence are depicted. In his works he reworks a figure from the fully naturalistic, through various phases, to pure abstraction and back again. He seeks to sketch the irrational thoughts that go through a person’s mind while making love. Jeff Ibbo comes from Copenhagen, where his art has attracted great attention.Over the past five or six years, he has studied under Professor Hjorth Nielsen at the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. This is the first time he is exhibiting in Sweden.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:db13adc70c:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jens-jorgen-thorsen","title":"JENS JØRGEN THORSEN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JENS JØRGEN THORSEN — PEINTURE BLASPHÉMATOIRE — 12-28.05.1978 JENS JØRGEN THORSENPEINTURE BLASPHÉMATOIRE12-28.05.1978","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:e57444ffd6:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jerzy-grabowski","title":"JERZY GRABOWSKI | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JERZY GRABOWSKI — TECKNINGAR GRAFIK — 11-23 May 1973 JERZY GRABOWSKITECKNINGAR GRAFIK11-23 May 1973 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund046 / 14 78 00 Datakonst kan de grafiska blad kallas – som JERZY GRABOWSKI från Warszawa visar i Galerie S:t Petri under tiden 11 – 23 maj.

Examining the integration of art with technical science. galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund046 / 14 78 00 JERZY GRABOWSKI – born 1933 in Gutki, Poland11–23 May 1973 “During my final years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, my critical attitude toward the art movements in Poland was shaped. I became aware of the influence of the ‘academists’ on me and grew skeptical toward the thesis of art’s subjective essence. By analogy I came to the conclusion that science, technology, and especially mathematics could assist me in my search, facilitating my liberation from emotionally subjective art and from aesthetic academism. I checked the rules and laws that apply in art to color, surface, picture composition, perspective, legibility. Nature studies, though not impressionistic-emotional, clarified the close affinity between the appearance of constructions of certain elements and those same elements themselves in relation to matter and the world of thought (symmetries, diagonals, axiality, etc.). The whole is integrated—therefore art must be extracted from the developmental totality that builds upon the artist’s subjective experiences. Beauty does not exist only within us; it also exists outside. Nature and technology are changing at a rapid pace. Everything people do changes. This is expressed in certain structural patterns in my compositions. Sometimes I tear them apart, cut them into strips—like a landscape intersected by motorways, railways, runways. The high-rise buildings of the streets are torn to pieces, erased, and assume a different content—at least artistically. I would like my production to become generally accessible, a mass article like books, records, TV, cars, irons, bread. Then the workplace must be radically altered—moving from the painter’s studio to the factory hall and the data center, where one can produce a number of identical and equivalent paintings. It is not reproduction I am after. The shift of the workshop is a way to win back lost time in the realization of the task. The events of today and their criteria are not the same as those of the past. Beyond mathematics and technology, folk art has provided inspiration. I feel especially close to the art of the Białystok region. There I have found many concrete examples of objective creation of an objective aesthetics. Folk art has the characteristic that it is less affected by academism and modern directions, and it preserves an original approach. The most varied compositions and structural elements in my work consciously connect with folk art. The elements themselves are often aggressive in nature, though unconsciously and without claims to any special meaning. They are simply corresponding mathematical units, code elements. The coloristic composition is primarily the effect of calculation. I advocate the integration of science, art, and technology.”","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:b2a6f5b29d:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jh-schuetz-uwe-poth","title":"JH SCHUETZ & UWE POTH | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"29.

Schuetz and Uwe Poth from Germany visit Galerie S:t Petri in Lund on June 29 and 30, 1979. Both work with photography and text; for J. H. Schuetz, the text often comes to the foreground, while Uwe Poth’s photographs form the framework for the narratives. J. H. Schuetz is originally American but now lives in West Berlin. His photographic project at Galerie S:t Petri is about finding the “heavenly” color through the development of ten sheets of light-sensitive paper with text — a kind of book.On these sheets he then writes down as much information as he finds essential in that very moment. It is the spontaneous feelings, the experiences in relation to the surroundings, and the book that appear to him as most important to convey. Uwe Poth has visited Lund twice before. In image and text he recounts his first visit. Glimpses of apparently insignificant things in and just outside S:t Petri are shown. During his second visit he captured the gallery in color photographs. Fragments of ceiling, walls, and floors seemed to him significant to document at that time. Now he is here for the third time. On Saturday at 6 p.m. he will give a performance in which the audience can also take part. White sheets of paper hang on the walls. During the performance he photographs what is important to him at that moment with a Polaroid camera and then writes down associations related to the images. He then lets the audience do the same — becoming participants in the creation of image and text. For Uwe Poth, as for J. H. Schuetz, everything is important.Through their images and stories, they show that everyday events are more meaningful and exciting than we usually think.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:73fc2dabfc:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jo-mallander","title":"J.O MALLANDER | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"J.O MALLANDER — 27.04 - 9.05.1973 J.O MALLANDER27.04 - 9.05.1973 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund046 / 14 78 00 Between April 27 and May 9, 1973, Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, presents conceptual art in the form of paper sculptures by the Stockholm- and Helsinki-based artist and art critic J.

During 1974, Mathews painted large monochrome works consisting of several panels hung together in a rectangular formation. Each panel contained tightly compressed parallel lines drawn in wet paint, either with a ruler or freehand. Once a line was made, it was never altered. For economic and spatial reasons, Joan Mathews stopped painting in the autumn of 1974. After much experimentation with various materials, she found that thick felt-tip pens and thin, inexpensive paper were well suited for her continued investigations. A razor blade also came into use, allowing the lines to run across a more varied surface. From time to time, accidents occurred with the blade — holes appeared in the paper. Sometimes these holes became the sole object of her research, sometimes they were combined with lines and paper. The main colours Joan Mathews uses in these structural studies are black, white, and grey. She often emphasizes that our lives are governed by chance, by coincidence, and that it makes no real difference what we do or how we attempt to control or organize our lives or our work — chance will always intervene. Joan Mathews seeks to collaborate with these coincidences rather than to eliminate them. This way of understanding her creative process has not been reached quickly. For about twenty years, she has been active in the American art world. From Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s, through the Fluxus and Happening movements of the 1960s, she has now arrived at a visual language that offers the viewer a remarkably wide perspective on themselves within a larger context. A meditative depth can be sensed in her work, making the images appear perpetually unfinished. The viewer is invited to continue the process through their own thoughts — and how far one can go depends largely on one’s personal life experience.

In the course of organizing a small but representational collective for an international tour, two parallel directions were considered: one dealing with reductivist-structural patterns, the other, being on the other side of the scale, concerned with improvisational body art actions. In different degrees all the performers operate in both methodologies. All the performances in the programme are non-verbal, some involve the audience, others are abstract private expressions. The most extreme position is Ron Gillespie’s theatre of terror as a spiritual context for the prophecy of a new biological man, which — differently from Beuys — declares the essential need of a collective new perceptive communication. The role of avant-garde art as destruction of obsolete rules is to trigger a creative freedom: spontaneity and intellectual activity by the mass. AMERIGO MARRAS, Toronto, 1976 MISSING ASSOCIATES Among the first ones to execute performances during the dark age of the first Canadian Avant-Garde, the Missing Associates (Peter Dudar, Lily Eng) stand out as some of the few to be called post-conceptual or more precisely reductivist-contextual. There exists in the work of the Missing Associates a duality of intention while they modify the dance premises of the older generation of avant-garde dance in North America.The duality outlines a dialectical space of art as contradictory element: On one hand Peter Dudar’s choreography is a work of relationships (sound-movement; field-periphery; speed-rhythm), on the other Lily Eng’s physical aggression against walls, corners, floors of a space. Peter works in group, Lily performs alone.The latter’s performances, sometimes sado-masochistic in nature, are rather electrifying, even more so for an audience too accustomed to the gestures of the old conceptual avant-garde. The film “RUNNING IN O AND R SIMULTANEOUSLY,” the latest work by the Missing Associates, has been first screened at the CEAC, Toronto, then at the Jonas Mekas’ Anthology Film Archives in New York, in May 1976. The work is a turning point or probably a clarification of the new contextual art in North America.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:33d6dd2270:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/john-fekner","title":"JOHN FEKNER | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JOHN FEKNER — NO TV/READ — STENCIL PROJECT press release JOHN FEKNERNO TV/READSTENCIL PROJECT press release01.11 - 12.11.1979 Why do people so often discuss TV programs instead of talking about their own lives with each other? Why do we allow ourselves to be so strongly influenced by TV that we soon live almost entirely through the characters in the shows, imitating their lifestyle and attitudes and forgetting to think for ourselves? John Fekner from the USA has long experienced TV as a distracting medium. When, in addition, American television contains commercials telling people what to buy, where to go, and how to dress, it becomes even more dangerous. We constantly let ourselves be influenced by external factors and seldom think very deeply about them. At the exhibition in Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, John Fekner therefore displays the international “No Parking” sign — not against parking but against TV — on a magnified scale. The symbol is placed in the gallery’s first room, where the large display windows face the street, allowing him to connect with the people outside. Usually, John Fekner works with the environment, the direct surroundings. His “environmental” projects in and outside New York are not conventional art objects but belong to and exist within the specific environment. Thus, he often works with young people in the neighborhoods where he plans projects, to activate them, to get them interested in other things than drugs, alcohol, or TV. To get people to think for themselves, to become more aware of their own opinions, is important to John Fekner. That is why, for example, he has painted a number of dates and years along the highways outside various major cities in the USA, where people spend a large part of their lives. In doing so, he wants them to think, to associate with something that happened earlier in their lives or that may happen in the future. At the exhibition in Galerie S:t Petri, he has also painted various dates so that visitors will remember and talk with each other about pleasant or less pleasant episodes in their lives. Perhaps, in this way, we might start to communicate with one another again, to rediscover each other, to become curious — instead of being numbed by TV. The exhibition runs from November 1–12, 1979, and is open weekdays from 3–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 12–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:11a0d1492c:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/jorgen-nash-60","title":"JØRGEN NASH | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JØRGEN NASH 60 — FULL/AHEAD — 20.03 - 28.03.1980 JØRGEN NASH 60FULL/AHEAD20.03 - 28.03.1980","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:efc9fa689e:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/josef-simon","title":"01-20.09.1972 JOSEF SIMON","content":"JOSEF SIMON — MÅLNINGAR — 01-20.09.1972 JOSEF SIMONMÅLNINGAR 01-20.09.1972 Below are the English translations of the three original documents related to Josef Simon’s exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri in 1972.

Kodály collected old folk melodies, but his own music, says Josef Simon, compared to these old tunes, is much more advanced, and the tones become visual color impressions. Kodály abstracts nature; through these tones Simon creates images of landscapes, which he then seeks to reproduce on his canvases. Document 2\"I want to free you from a dogmatic perception.

In the mid-1960s, Ken Friedman became a member of the Fluxus group and founded Fluxus West (California).Other Fluxus centers existed in Denmark and France.Fluxus is both an organization and an idea.It exists primarily as a reference framework for the exchange of information, for publications, and for collaboration in collective contexts. Thus, cooperation among the different members has taken place in the form of Flux events, Flux boxes, Flux kits, and Flux fests.Flux events are, for example, small cards on which ideas for happenings are written — happenings that can, or perhaps only need to, take place in the imagination.Some of these events are presented at Galerie S:t Petri. Many of these “events,” says Ken Friedman, create a tension between the work and the viewer, where the latter simultaneously becomes both reflected and involved.Events generate social interaction and can be varied and interpreted in many ways, while still remaining unified in theme.They are materially simple yet intellectually complex.They demonstrate unity rather than divergence among such art forms as correspondence art, process art, music, collage, electronics, and fields such as psychology, pedagogy, sociology, and so on. Ken Friedman has communicated these ideas and thoughts in numerous exhibitions around the world.He has had more than forty solo exhibitions in Europe and America.His writings have been translated into nine languages, and he has given numerous lectures at various universities in the USA and Canada. In his works, Ken Friedman avoids limiting himself to rigid, conventional structures within art.Instead, he uses psychological, sociological, and environmental concepts as material for aesthetic creation and communication. The exhibition is open weekdays from 3–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 12–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:37928837db:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/kenneth-welfare","title":"07-26.01.1972 KENNETH WELFARE","content":"KENNETH WELFARE — MÅLNINGAR — 07-26.01.1972 KENNETH WELFAREMÅLNINGAR07-26.01.1972 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund KENNETH WELFARE – painter (1939 Brighton England)7 – 26 january 1972 \"I was born in Brighton in the South of England, and have always been fascinated by the landscape of that area.

The exhibition spans a ten-year period, 1968–1978, and provides information about Klaus Groh’s diverse activities in the form of photographs, manifestos, books, writings, and more. Klaus Groh’s philosophy is to encourage action at every possible opportunity. A positive attitude toward humanity’s capacity to think and act shapes his work — life becomes what you make it. He emphasizes: “To live means to constantly try again, not to give up or let oneself become passive. To live is art. The one who creates, lives. Try and try again! Every creative act is a document of one’s individuality.” We live in a world that too often discourages innovation. Art arises frequently as a reaction to events in the social environment. Art can make people more conscious of themselves so that they can take positions and make decisions in a more nuanced way. This aim was already expressed by the Dadaists about sixty years ago. Klaus Groh starts from Dada as an attitude to life, not as something bound to its time. The classical Dadaists reacted to their environment with alternative expressions and standpoints. Likewise, the “neo-Dadaists.” The classical Dadaist tried to create in order to find himself; the neo-Dadaist, however, tries to create in order to show how one can find oneself. The process of communication thus becomes more important for the neo-Dadaists than the product. “Who I am is not as important — I become what I do,” says the American Dick Higgins. The task of every artist and person is to follow the social and cultural traces of our time. To identify these, information and constant movement are necessary — a readiness to communicate on many nuanced levels brings knowledge. The Dadaist attitude to life cannot be confined to any single discipline — the poly-artist is necessary. The neo-Dadaists maintain: “Everything can be art!” For international communication, the postal system and telegraph have come to play an essential role. It is easy to reach each other, exchange ideas, spread ideas by sending letters, telegrams, and phone calls. This form of art is not bound to commercial centers. For the neo-Dadaists, the audience is important.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ca97de6a56:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/knud-holar","title":"22.09 - 11.10.1972 KNUD HOLAR","content":"KNUD HOLAR — MÅLNINGAR — 22.09 - 11.10.1972 KNUD HOLARMÅLNINGAR22.09 - 11.10.1972 Galerie S:t Petri S:t PetriKyrkogata 5 Lund 046 / 14 78 00 KNUD HOLAR 22 September – 11 October 1972 Art is an emotional experience transformed by each observer!","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:1a78483474:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/kollektiv-herzogstrasse","title":"KOLLEKTIV HERZOGSTRASSE | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"KOLLEKTIV HERZOGSTRASSE — TREFFEN IN LUND — 3 - 5 SEPTEMBER 1976 KOLLEKTIV HERZOGSTRASSETREFFEN IN LUND3 - 5 SEPTEMBER 1976 Poets, writers, philosophers, psychologists, and many others regularly visit this small cultural center and share their experiences. For its fifth anniversary, Galerie S:t Petri invites everyone interested to take part in the actions offered by the artist group Kollektiv Herzogstrasse from Munich.Some members of the collective previously belonged to the well-known Gruppe Spur, which was active in Germany in the early and mid-1960s.That group arose largely as a reaction to alienation between people and to the suppression of the individual in a society that developed during the 1960s.In a certain sense, Kollektiv Herzogstrasse may be said to carry forward the ideas of Gruppe Spur.However, the eleven Germans who form the collective today approach things from the perspective of the problems of the 1970s. The members of the group are:Hans Bachmayer, Renate Bachmayer, Jutta von Busse, Heiko Herrmann, Thomas Niggle, Heimrad Prem, Armin Saub, Dieter Strauch, Ursula Strauch, Helmut Sturm, Heini Weld. According to Kollektiv Herzogstrasse, the great lack of imagination among people must be fought above all.They believe that a lack of imagination leads to brutality.Neither mass parties nor groups that rely on the quantity of their members can count on success in the future.The latter statement comes from the Situationist theorist Vaneigem.Quantitative, technocratic divisions of the world are evil, they say.Art must encourage imagination, creativity, and spontaneity.In this way, opportunities are created for individual freedom, even within the group.Art must not, according to the collective, become formalist or indulge in serving power.The collective tries to balance in its art an analytical and emotional, spontaneous approach. Galerie S:t Petri’s expanded activities with its publishing house and archive will continue to serve as a didactic forum for experimental and marginal art, without any political, religious, or economic implications. A commemorative volume by Carsten Regild, creator of the cultural magazine Vargen, has been published in connection with the fifth anniversary in support of the gallery. The exhibition with Kollektiv Herzogstrasse runs from 3–15 September 1976.Open weekdays 3 p.m.–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12 p.m.–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:e944ea9b74:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/konrad-balder-schauffelen","title":"KONRAD BALDER SCHÄUFFELEN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"KONRAD BALDER SCHÄUFFELEN — OBJEKT SPRÅK SPRÅK-OBJEKT — 30.03 - 8.04.1973 KONRAD BALDER SCHÄUFFELENOBJEKT SPRÅK SPRÅK-OBJEKT30.03 - 8.04.1973 Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5Lund046/14 78 00 Object-language – language-objects is what Konrad Balder Schäuffelen calls his exhibition, which will be shown at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, from 30 March to 18 April 1973.This is the first time that this Munich-based artist is exhibiting at all in Sweden. Schäuffelen studied medicine and philosophy in Germany and France. Between 1966 and 1970, he worked as a psychiatrist at the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry in Munich. He is still a practicing psychiatrist. Schäuffelen is interested in the dual functions of words. Beyond their semantic meaning, words also have an intrinsic value as symbols. Words are not only used to clarify and explain; they are also often used with the aim of confusing and obscuring, for example, by bureaucrats and other authorities.

With the help of, among other things, sequential photographs, Krystyna Baker seeks to convey various emotional expressions — joy, sorrow, anticipation.The expression on a person’s face can reveal much about her inner life.But people sometimes wear masks and conceal what they really wish to show.The fear of revealing ourselves too clearly to another person, and of perhaps being hurt, makes us close off our emotional lives.We play games, deceiving both ourselves and others. In addition to photographs, Krystyna Baker also shows paintings in which the square plays a significant role.To her, the square represents the various possibilities of realizing ourselves and communicating with others.It is your square, my square, his square, her square — and we must make the most of it without trampling on others.It is openness, honesty, and the sense of community between people that Krystyna Baker seeks to bring forth.

For several years now, Wodiczko has been working with visual illusions that can take many different forms. The exhibition in Lund is called “Drawings of Lines”, and the artist describes it as follows: “The drawings are placed in the room on the walls and in the corners.The drawings in the corners are the first phase.The drawings — on the walls — of simple lines, horizontal, slanted, and vertical, are the most important.The drawings are not illusions of any object whatsoever, nor do they describe any forms.The drawings are not illusions of objects but become concrete visual objects themselves — that is, lines.The drawings, the lines, are concrete regardless of how they have been made, seen, associated, or examined.” Drawings of Lines is presented for the first time outside Poland.The theme has been preceded by other drawings, where the first was called “Drawing of a Chair”, a drawing of an illusion of an object.The second, “Drawing of a Chair” and “Drawing of a Line”, showed the illusion of both an object and an illusory drawing of a line.The third, “A Ladder” and “Drawing of a Chair”, described the illusion of an illusory object as well as a drawing of an illusion of a drawing of an illusion of an object.All the works were previously exhibited at Galerie Akumulatory 2 in Poznań and Galerie Foksal in Warsaw. Krzysztof Wodiczko is a lecturer at the University of Warsaw.He works with art and technical problems.He has also visited various universities in the USA as a guest lecturer in art.In a few days, he will travel to Canada for the same purpose.

They must speak for themselves as best they can.Instead, I will quote Jean-Paul Sartre. Some years ago, he said this in an interview in the French newspaper Le Monde:‘I am astonished that world hunger, the atomic threat, and human misery do not color all literature.’This could equally well be said of visual art. Who today can paint landscapes unaffected by environmental destruction, poisoning, and exploitation? How can one engage in aesthetic problems when reality is so cruel and unaesthetic? It is an escape from reality. Suffering is inconceivable. The human dimension is lost, and need becomes abstract.I believe that the image — both the pure reportage photograph and especially the artistic, sharpened one — has an important function to fulfill. We can hear a thousand words, read a thousand stencils and newspaper articles, without for that reason truly being able to imagine the reality behind the words. An image can make words tangible, make facts come alive, and perhaps — perhaps one of my pictures might be the ‘right’ one for someone, the image that speaks, that makes reality real.”","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:76e8396799:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/lene-adler-petersen","title":"LENE ADLER PETERSEN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"LENE ADLER PETERSEN — ET SANDT VARVAR — 07 - 18.12.1974 LENE ADLER PETERSENET SANDT VARVAR07 - 18.12.1974","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:d08f79958c:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/lennart-gummeson","title":"21.04 - 10.05.1972 LENNART GUMMESON","content":"LENNART GUMMESON — MÅLNINGAR — 21.04 - 10.05.1972 LENNART GUMMESONMÅLNINGAR21.04 - 10.05.1972 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund LENNART GUMMESON presents in his first solo exhibition in Lund about ten paintings as well as a few pastels.One could say that the exhibition is to some extent retrospective, as it spans works from the early 1950s up until now.

Artistic creation is today, as we all know, subject to economic speculation. This means that the artist often no longer works for the sake of art itself but for personal gain. Speculation in art, especially within the unique easel painting tradition, a remnant from the Renaissance, has led many artists to seek new means of communication more frequently, in order to avoid profiteering and fashionable trends. For some years now, a kind of cultural guerrilla has been active, despite constant and harsh resistance. (Daniel Buren banned at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, Jiří Kolář refused in Prague, Freddie censored in Copenhagen, Mathelin whose two paintings were confiscated at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris, etc.). This guerrilla aims to break with the structures of the capitalist market, to place itself outside of it. The architectural, cold character of the immense geometric figures in, for example, the United States, reveals only a desire to fill space. Modern creators no longer present their works for profit, but as symbolic objects to be owned by all. When the socialization of the aesthetic function is fully accomplished – to mention just one thing – the artist will appear as a researcher enriching daily life. He then becomes the architect of leisure, of that immense, endless festival of which our life should consist. Today’s artists will not be numerous enough to create this new joy of life. Such humanism is not as distant as we might think. Therefore, we must already do our best and definitively break with the romanticism of earlier centuries. Galerie S:t Petri presents in its sixth exhibition 22 artists from 11 different nations, almost all of whom have been confronted with contemporary Sweden. In this way, the gallery, despite its limited resources, wishes to remind us of the universality of artistic creation, to offer artists – often lacking means – the opportunity to inform us about their efforts, their tendencies. All these painters, graphic artists, and sculptors, at various stages of their development, with more or less strength, appear as an essential contribution to the cultural development of Sweden. raymond mahout","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:b9fc575cfc:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/lundadabank","title":"LUNDADA BANK | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"LUNDADA BANK — FOUNDED DECEMBER 15, 1977 — NOT RECOGNIZED BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES LUNDADA BANKFOUNDED DECEMBER 15, 1977NOT RECOGNIZED BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES15.12.1977 LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte 10:- Edition Sellem, c/o Galerie S:t Petri, Lund On December 15, 1977, a play entitled LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte was performed at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund — the non-commercial and non-institutional idea laboratory. At the same time, a mysterious bank was founded: LUNDADA BANK. The gallery had been closed for just under nine months because certain political forces opposed its artistic and spiritual spirit. A local top politician, Birger Rehn (Social Democrat), made several statements in the Lunda Gazette, arguing that one had to bow to party discipline and therefore could not support the gallery’s activities, which were in a precarious financial situation. Nevertheless, support was granted. Galerie S:t Petri decided to enlist the Polish master draftsman Andrzej Płoski as the central figure in the play, which was staged at 3 p.m. on that day (December 15). The City Council of Lund was to decide whether the gallery could receive a small silver coin. Jean Sellem, who founded Lundada Bank and printed its first banknotes, staged LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte, dressed in a tailcoat and top hat, while Andrzej Płoski wandered around in a red dressing gown and Santa Claus hat. Galerie S:t Petri decided that all activities should be financed with pure money; a pure coin was worth a ten-note. Two slogans appeared on the bills: “One for all, all for one” and “Unity gets punished.” The Copernican artist Andrzej Płoski — in LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte called Sven-Olof — and the French artist Jean Sellem, who also directs S:t Petri, apparently carried out the play Papou Y’ang to everyone’s delight. At seven o’clock, the City of Learning, Lund, granted Galerie S:t Petri fifteen thousand pure, freshly washed kronor. LUNDIUS Commedia dell’arte, a parody of the decadent cultural outlook of Lund and Sweden, has now been published as a book and is available for ten kronor exclusively through Galerie S:t Petri, S:t Petri Kyrkogata 5, Lund. The edition hopes to cover its expenses and — if the stars shine favorably — help Andrzej Płoski, who until now has been occupied with cleaning and tulip picking.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:fc4b828562:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/luzzi-herzog-palle-budtz","title":"LUZZI HERZOG & PALLE BUDTZ | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"LUZZI HERZOG & PALLE BUDTZ — COLLAGES — 28.09 - 10.10.1973 LUZZI HERZOG & PALLE BUDTZCOLLAGES28.09 - 10.10.1973 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund046/14 78 00 During the period 28 September – 10 October 1973,Palle Budtz and Luzzi Herzog from Stockholm exhibit collages at Galerie S:t Petri.

Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, in collaboration with the Department of Art History, presents the exhibition “Made in the 20th Century” by the Danish artist STEEN HØYER, taking place from 14–20 June 1976. The working title of the experiment aims, in relation to every object and every statement, to introduce an undefinable distance — in time and space — to every situation.This can be seen as an example of a dimension of experience. The arrangement is constructed as a whole; the objects are made in and with the space.It has been shown previously and will not be repeated. Steen Høyer says about the exhibition: “There exists only one concrete political alternative — that of action, from whose material the future paves its way.Therefore, I establish situations like this one, open attempts to reveal new contexts within familiar problem areas.It is a matter of pure qualitative character, as I do not consider quantity to be lasting.(Quantity may be vital, but in a country like Sweden it is almost a burden.)My and your experience is based on concrete situations, and the value of the content is proportional to its intensity.As in life generally, it concerns a kind of celebration — and even the best must risk their good will and a bit of courage.” “I create an event with an ideological content. It is therefore open, yet also ‘complete,’ ready for processing from my side — and thereby historically — since creation itself is the act for everyone, and art is the courage to do it completely!” “All things and situations in everyday life can be intensified and create broader conscious connections — though, of course, not all stories are equally interesting.Yet every story always carries a mutual personal risk!(A well-known story is a trivial act that represents repetition and security — and there are never the same tensions in situations that are repetitive.Therefore, when it is said that something is ‘never before seen,’ it still concerns the connections and the way we experience them.)” “I therefore believe it is important and necessary to create a reasonable history — more as a process than as a finished picture or series.” Note: The vertical line of text at the left margin reads: “The exhibition is shown at the Department of Art History, 3rd floor, Universitetshuset, weekdays 9–15.30.”","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:5352c24ff7:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/magasin-tessin","title":"MAGASIN TESSIN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MAGASIN TESSIN — 17.05.1980 AT 6PM MAGASIN TESSIN17.05.1980 AT 6PM On Saturday at 6:00 p.m., Magasin Tessin — the new journal for architecture, aesthetics, and environmental criticism — will be presented at Galerie S:t Petri. Magasin Tessin is published in Lund by a group of younger architects and art historians in collaboration with the publishing house Bokförlaget Doxa. Exactly fifty years ago, in 1930, the Stockholm Exhibition opened. It marked the definitive breakthrough for the direction in architecture known as functionalism, whose fundamental ideas have since influenced construction in our country and in much of Europe. With the rise of large-scale, industrialized building in the 1960s and 1970s, the positive aspects of functionalism gradually disappeared, while its negative aspects became increasingly evident: the division of the city into separate functions, the resulting increase in private housing, and the proliferation of stereotypical, monotonous urban areas — first high-rises, then small houses, demolitions, and the depletion of old cities in favor of sterile architecture without decorative elements. The criticism of functionalist ideas is almost as old as functionalism itself. But it is only since the 1970s that it has gained renewed attention — and with it, the need for alternatives to functionalism. New ways of thinking about cities and construction must now emerge. Magasin Tessin aims to be a forum for such alternatives. • Magasin Tessin will address questions of architecture, design, and the urban environment from a broad cultural-historical, theoretical, and critical perspective. It will also connect with the humanistic research tradition, which believes that architects and planners must have the confidence to fulfill these tasks. • Magasin Tessin seeks to make aesthetic issues come alive by activating and presenting debates and research across different artistic fields. • Magasin Tessin strives to promote and broaden the discussion about the importance of the physical environment for human life. Magasin Tessin will be published four times a year, with a total of over 200 pages of text, drawings, and images. A subscription costs 60 kronor. A single issue costs 20 kronor. Magasin Tessin will be available in well-stocked bookstores and tobacco shops.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:3168d19f88:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/magnus-malmsten","title":"MAGNUS MALMSTEN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MAGNUS MALMSTEN — TV IS ART — 19.10.1979 MAGNUS MALMSTENTV IS ART19.10.1979 TV IS ART In one of his books Nietzsche mentions two trends in Art — two branches growing from one and the same tree and named after the Greek gods Apollo and Dionysius. Apollo, we know, represents a sublime, classical and exalted type of love and devotion — our nobler self — whereas Dionysius is the god of wine, lust and drunken orgies, our baser self. Apollo-inspired Art transcends the decadence in Society, creating instead a synthesis which yields the ideal and pure harmony found, for example, in the ecstatically glowing painting of Sam Francis, with its refined light, depicting the shores of the Pacific, or in Henry Matisse’s calm and dignified paper-collage from Tahiti and the South Pacific. The Dionysius painters, on the other hand, dwell on — and refer their spectators to — all that is decadent and depraved in a hopelessly confused and meaningless society of mass consumption. The New York artists Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist are a few of those who create such art. To ask ourselves which Art trend we should find best for ourselves, however, is oversimplifying matters. The mythical alchemists were the first in our civilization who dared to call themselves artists. For them all life was Art. With the help of astrology and philosophy they mixed chemical substances and bathed themselves and their metals in increasingly more refined materials. Beginning with the belief that the base metals symbolized our earthly matter, they symbolized them with the planet Venus, whose material charm symbolized beauty and softness, hence to the planet Mercury, whose metal silver symbolized thought and identity, and so, one may say, the philosopher reached that whole state of mind called the soul itself. In the same way the alchemists’ work finds its modern analogue in New York City. On the contrary, do not glorify the eccentric but let him have and enjoy life instead of kick standing on the street. They are body-artists who have transformed their bodies to the utmost beauty in the true sense, changing their misery into gold and silver, their chaos into joy, despair into devotion, ugliness into form, loosening their hooks from the mad machine of industrialism and collective existence. They are people who can see beauty in suffering. They are like roses and thorns, an aesthetic symbol of our modern society. By loving the roses we can see beyond the thorns. But through the thorns we can show the beauty within ourselves. Nothing is static. All is energy. Everything can be transformed just as the alchemists of old have shown. In New York today prostitution itself has reached an aesthetic status; music grows within women’s make-up who wander the sidewalks from village to village, prostituting themselves and seducing men and seducting everyone around them. Hiera and Parikas, classic priestesses of Dionysus, had the task of delivering their female bodies as ecstatic mystic whores whose goal is apparently holy. The goddess of love and of beauty manifests her divine truth through the medium of the temple and of the body — and here America experiences its real releases. Apollos and Brahmins are two extremes in society. Both are equally important. But only by experiencing the ultimate destruction of life can the individual attain bliss. Meditation and self-denial are therefore as important as the physical self-revelation of experiencing Brahmanism or sexual liberation. The mere life of a New York City TV is nearer to social reality than that made by any avantgarde painter. Here we still have much to learn. For a great painter must not allow himself to be hindered by the ballast of social conventions or limited consciousness. The true task of the artist is to throw overboard all limitations and become a visionary. — Magnus MalmstenOctober, 1979 Statement published by: Galerie S:t Petri Archive of Experimental and Marginal Art Fack 7 221 01 Lund Sweden","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ba979c05c6:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/magrit-kahl","title":"MAGRIT KAHL | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MARGRIT KAHL — DAS ZEREBRALE IN DER KUNST — 29. 09 - 28.10.1978 MARGRIT KAHLDAS ZEREBRALE IN DER KUNST29. 09 - 28.10.1978 The Function of the Human Brain and the Compulsion Toward an Analytical State of Consciousness in Advanced Industrial Society — Reflections on the Avant-Garde of the Visual Arts in the Second Half of the 1970s, Exemplified by the Work of Margrit Kahl From 1970 to 1975, Margrit Kahl studied sculpture and the theory of artistic work under Franz Erhard Walther at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste in Hamburg, within the framework of an expanded concept of art. In 1975, she co-founded the artist initiative Galerie vor Ort. Since the early 1970s, she has been experimenting in the field of phenomenologically oriented studies on certain movement experiences of the human body. The central theme of her photographic studies appears highly symptomatic of contemporary art and reflects the consequences of the artistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s, which focused on questions of human identity and the ontological issues of modern industrial society. This raises the question of whether Margrit Kahl’s interest in Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, Husserl, and Heidegger allows us to conclude that she advocates a form of phenomenologically motivated art.Her engagement with these philosophers is connected to the question of existence, the notion of autonomy, the problem of form and content, and the question of what constitutes artistic authenticity. Her artistic goal is to grasp human existence in a phenomenal way. In this sense, one could indeed speak of a phenomenologically motivated approach. That she does not align herself with any particular -ism in her artistic activity is thus understandable. We shall not dwell on terminological distinctions here — but it is precisely against this background that the conception of her work can be clearly distinguished from the aims of Behaviour Art. When we consider the artistic expressions of many contemporary artists, especially those of the avant-garde, the gap seems to be widening between what could be described as phenomenologically motivated art, in contrast to Behaviour Art. In fact, the two views do overlap. Yet two fundamentally different conceptions can be discerned regarding the position of the human being in his environment:one, the view that the human being is merely a product of his environment — that is, a more behaviourist or analytical attitude;the other, the phenomenological attitude, which asserts that the human being shapes society.There thus exists a fundamental distinction between, for example, dialectical materialism and Freudian interpretation on the one hand, and the standpoint of Kantian philosophy on the other. In the mid-1970s, several scientists, based on methodological studies, arrived at the conclusion that the two hemispheres of the human brain have different functions: the left side performs a more analytical function, while the right side performs a more synthetic one. McLuhan (*) reflected on this issue. Without developing a biological theory, he suggested that the hemisphere associated with the more analytical role has, in the course of the progress of communication technologies, evolved cybernetically, while the other hemisphere, less developed in this respect, controls the movements of the opposite side of the body.If one considers Margrit Kahl’s concept of action, which underlies her work “Circular Movement of Both Hands Simultaneously in One Direction and Slow Increase of the Speed of Movement” (1974) — where the lower hand, as the tempo increases, begins to move in the opposite direction — this conception appears very current and relevant, as it makes the phenomenon of cerebral asymmetry visible. In connection with this, Margrit Kahl conducted an experiment in which she walked blindfolded across an open field for a distance of 50 meters. Her path curved to the right.The viewer of her work “Asymmetry of the Free Movement of Man” (1971) will likewise recognize that both the asymmetry of the brain and the gravity of the Earth play a significant role. The question, however, arises as to whether Margrit Kahl is consciously aware of these interrelations, or whether her concepts arise from intuition.The starting point of Margrit Kahl’s artistic interest was the study of traditional sculpture, which she was already engaged in before her later teacher, Franz Erhard Walther, arrived in Hamburg.Her main interest at that time lay in life studies, where, in drawing or sculptural studies of the human body, the aspects of statics, proportion, and space constitute the essential conditions of form. However, since for her the central question was not the fixed representation of the human being as a sculptural figure, but rather the existential problem of human existence, she came to the conviction that she had to liberate herself from the statics of sculpture. This first took place through the attempt to capture sequences of movement in drawing before a model, in which the factor of time played a crucial role.Franz Erhard Walther’s definition of an expanded concept of art prompted Margrit Kahl to undertake a thorough reflection on her previous work. It became important for her to find a form through pure movement, through its dynamic aspect, that is — without object, material, or sculpture.The physiological conditions of movement appeared to her worth investigating; these studies at first had nothing to do with art. The artistic treatment of these phenomena, however, took place primarily on an intuitive level. Because she works with bodily movement, there is a risk that her creative-phenomenological practice might be misunderstood as Behaviour Art.It is noteworthy that Karl Thomas, in his “Keywords of Twentieth-Century Art,” classifies Walther’s work as Behaviour Art — erroneously equating it with Pop Art and Socialist Realism, which view the human being as an object and product of society.To return once again to “Asymmetry of the Free Movement of Man”: one might also consider another aspect — namely, the attempt to visually represent the difference between the supposed objectivity of science and human subjectivity. Here, the human being is viewed as a subjective entity. Margrit Kahl presents her works in series. In doing so, she deliberately avoids the possibility of any supplementary linguistic interpretation.Most modern artists give their works only psychological and/or sociological interpretations, without taking the humanistic dimension into account. How, then, does Margrit Kahl understand this discrepancy? She refers to Husserl’s phenomenology. Edmund Husserl opposed psychologism and maintained that logic must be kept separate from psychology.He regarded logic as a pure a priori science, dealing, among other things, with concepts and parts of propositions as timeless ideal entities. Margrit Kahl considers it necessary to present her works in series, since sequences of movement always unfold within real temporal duration.She cannot imagine an “external synthesis” of a movement, as this would contradict its very nature. For her, literature has little in common with visual art, and she therefore insists on excluding any literary aspect.However, she does not oppose a humanistic interpretation of her work.Her concern is with the totality of the human being. Such an “externally synthetic” representation of the whole would, in her view, obscure certain moments of experience.In the visual comparison of forms, she perceives the possibility of obtaining an image of the multidimensional human being.For her, the phenomenological comparison of forms is a way of approaching a consciousness of human totality. It may at first seem contradictory that Margrit Kahl maintains a phenomenological and synthetic approach, yet works consistently in a structuralist manner, assuming a separation between visual art and literature.However, this issue is not relevant for her, since she understands literature as description and visual art as the generation of form from a principle of creation. Nevertheless, she does not exclude empathy within creative and anthropological attitudes, and in this structuralist sense, such a position does not, for her, contradict a phenomenological orientation.Here, she returns to Husserl, who conceived synthesis as the primordial form of consciousness and identification as a basic form of synthesis. Husserl completely distinguishes between ordinary analysis, which proceeds analytically from the “data” of consciousness — that would correspond to the structuralist view — and intentional analysis of consciousness, which also leads to divisions but whose distinctive function is the revelation of potentialities. When Margrit Kahl engages with elementary bodily movements, she necessarily arrives at an analytical consideration of form.Questions associated with this — of symmetry and asymmetry of the body, as well as of the Earth’s gravity — have, of course, long been known to scientists, philosophers, and artists alike.Yet these insights have exerted upon Kahl such a powerful compulsion toward an analytical state of consciousness. This tendency has become clearly visible in contemporary visual art since the mid-1970s — for instance, in Peter Campus, who projects his own image and double image through video.One may ask whether this long-familiar theme of self-reflection in art history is related to self-representation in Happening and Performance Art, or to the persistently claustrophobic and schizophrenic feeling expressed in Expressionism. The art of Margrit Kahl can be described as cerebral, since it constantly appeals to both hemispheres of the brain.The risk exists that her work might be interpreted merely as drawing upon the insights of biology and physiology, and thereby assigned to a purely Skinnerian mode of thought. How does she distinguish between experience (Erlebnis) and understanding through experience (Erfahrung), and how has this distinction influenced her work?When she reflects on an original experience, she presupposes a previously applied reductive method. For her, Erlebnis (lived experience) is associated with chance and spontaneity. The asymmetry in the Yin-Yang symbols and Zen Buddhism have undoubtedly inspired her — Yin and Yang, which symbolize all the fundamental conditions of life’s dualisms: the male and the female, day and night, heaven and earth, the positive and the negative. Margrit Kahl considers Concept Art to be sterile, because this artistic direction is based primarily on thought rather than on perception.However, when it deals with human action, a conceptual starting point is inevitably contained within it.She regards it as a limitation when Idea Art is intended only to generate concepts, while the element of sensory perception is missing.For the act of action, however, she makes use of conceptions, since through them she determines movement parameters. Because Margrit Kahl’s art can be viewed both philosophically and psychologically, it is necessary to relate her work to the newer tendencies in art as well as to the intellectual efforts to engage with questions of human existence.It is evident that the collapse of modern society, both socialist and capitalist, signifies not only an ideological crisis but also the consequence of a certain mathematical progression — characterized, among other things, by inflation, militarization, environmental crises, overpopulation, and unemployment. If we take as our point of departure American Abstract Expressionism, with Jackson Pollock at its forefront, or consider Pop Art, Minimal Art, Concept Art, Happening, or Performance Art — in short, all the newer tendencies that developed from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s — we can understand that, in my view, they perfectly illustrate the four pillars of materialist philosophical positions: structuralism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and, to some extent, existentialism. Yet the elegance of this correspondence is not without tragedy. The artist, equipped with his modern video technology, has often witnessed with his own eyes that the dream of man as a robot has no future, and that the pursuit of material enrichment encounters definite limits.There is therefore no other way out than to create autonomy in form and/or in artistic conception. Without denying the positive aspects of advanced industrial society, and without wishing to appear anachronistic, some artists have finally come to understand the destructive tendencies inherent in such artistic movements. The content of Margrit Kahl’s art is of great relevance to modern humanity, for it visually represents the lack of coordination and balance in the brain caused by technology.It is no coincidence that a number of modern artists have been dealing with the problem of the brain at a time when mini-computers are already in the hands of schoolchildren. That artists such as Seurat, Malevich, Mondrian, Yves Klein, and Ad Reinhardt — to name only a few — have represented, through their paintings and imagination, Newton’s theory of color in a behaviorist–metaphysical way within twentieth-century art, already points clearly in this direction.The question arises whether an exclusively behaviorist art, such as Pop Art and Socialist Realism, might not lead to a far-reaching degradation of the human being. The creative-phenomenological intention that Margrit Kahl pursues in an extremely structuralist world is directed toward achieving a greater human equilibrium.

To draw a cube in two dimensions, twelve straight lines are required, placed in a specific order.In doing so, an illusion is created in the mind that we are seeing a three-dimensional figure.This is only possible because we have acquired knowledge through experience in the perceptual (real) three-dimensional world.However, if one removes lines from the cube, a new, two-dimensional “graphic being” arises.It is this very process that Manfred Mohr presents in his exhibition in Lund. By analyzing the visual idea — in this case, the cube — its internal structure and elementary composition become apparent.What characterizes the generative systems Mohr uses is the multiplicity of unique drawings they produce.Through various mathematical–logical calculations of the possible visual variations of a static cube — by successively varying the twelve lines of which the two-dimensional cube consists — Mohr destroys the three-dimensional illusion while preserving the cube’s rigid structure.Even the two-dimensional images that arise as the cube rotates and different lines are gradually removed are shown. All the possibilities of the cube that can be seen in the exhibition have been reached through logical–mathematical reasoning.Manfred Mohr believes it is important to seek and demonstrate the path toward a non-mystified aesthetic communication. In addition to the cube, other signs and symbols are presented.Instead of depicting an event sequence with symbols — all different in form and size — he seeks thereby to emphasize the uniqueness of each statement. This is the first solo exhibition by Manfred Mohr in Sweden.The gallery is open weekdays 3–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 1–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:c6141caa3b:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/maria-nevelson","title":"MARIA NEVELSON | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MARIA NEVELSON — Paris-Basel 1973-1974 — Aufnahme (n) Photographien MARIA NEVELSON Paris-Basel 1973-1974Aufnahme (n) Photographien10 - 22.03.1978 The next exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund deals with how human beings optically register reality as it changes in time and space. “Maria Nevelson, Paris–Basel 1973–1974” depicts a train journey between these two cities, and the intention is to give a visual description of how we can “read” the landscape as the train rushes forward. Ordinarily, we perceive the “classical” landscape “in depth,” from a stationary viewpoint. Our perception then takes place through a (perspectival) “penetrating” and “discontinuous” point of view. However, if we start instead from a moving point of fixation, we “read” the landscape as “linear,” “fluid,” and “continuous.” To capture these shifting points of view, a journey was made on a fast-moving train. A camera, focused at infinity and placed in front of a window, recorded—without any particular intervention from the operator—the image of the landscape as the camera saw it. This journey was repeated several times over the course of the four seasons. Some of the results of this experiment show that the more successively one fixes points in reality—that is, travels “linearly”—the blurrier and less precise the image becomes. In terms of distance perception, what is farthest away appears the least blurred. A parallel might be drawn to human memory: we remember best and most clearly what lies furthest back in time. In the exhibition, which ends on March 22, 1978, several of the images recorded by the camera during the journey are presented. Galerie S:t Petri has organized the exhibition in collaboration with the Modern Art Agency in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, and the magazine Apeiros. Opening hours: weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 13:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:cb25c3c7c4:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/marie-sjoberg-letter-of-appeal","title":"MARIE SJÖBERG LETTER OF APPEAL | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MARIE SJÖBERG — LETTER OF APPEAL — JANUARY 1980 This petition was signed by more than 300 people around the world. Original English version of the Letter of Appeal by Marie Sjöberg (image no. 1) Dear Friend, The independent and non-commercial art laboratory Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, Sweden, is now in its ninth year of activity, having become internationally recognized as a result of exhibiting and supporting a very large number of contemporary artists from all parts of the globe. Despite its now excellent facilities — five exhibition rooms plus living accommodation for visiting artists and an important archive — the Swedish authorities have refused to provide a minimum subsistence for Jean Sellem, who has carried on the gallery with all its cultural activities since the start in 1971 without any remuneration or economic support for his existence. We trust you will express your protest against this situation by signing the enclosed petition — together with any of your friends interested in the contemporary arts — and returning it to us as soon as possible.

We note that this refusal constitutes a clear breach of the declared policy of the Swedish government’s support for the arts and flies in the face of competent academic opinion both in Sweden and abroad. Name Title Address Date English translation of the Letter of Appeal by Marie Sjöberg (image no. 3) To artists and writers in Scandinavia Nearly nine years ago, Jean Sellem founded the experimental idea and art laboratory Galerie S:t Petri in Lund and has since then run it strictly non-commercially — that is, without any sales — a unique phenomenon in Sweden. It is a meeting place outside institutions and commerce, for creative people. Only after six years of intensive activity and nine months of controversy with the local politicians did the gallery receive the support of all political parties in Lund, which has meant that about three-quarters of the rent are now covered. After appealing to the Minister of Education last year, the gallery received a one-time grant from a foundation, partly for repairs and partly for certain fixed expenses. Over these years, however, Jean Sellem has tirelessly worked to animate this experimental and avant-garde art environment, internationally respected as an idea and art laboratory, and has depended entirely on friends for his survival. The time has now come to protest against the fact that Swedish cultural authorities — who claim to support and encourage non-commercial initiatives, experimental ideas, and research — have not, according to democratic rules, found a legal way to make room for art that is not directly subordinate to the state. Consequently, Jean Sellem has been unable to obtain any form of economic security. Despite recommendations from prominent cultural figures that Jean Sellem be granted a state income guarantee, and despite the fact that his case is known to both the State Arts Council and the Artists’ Board, he still finds himself in the same precarious situation — that is, he has nothing to live on. Hundreds of well-known academics, artists, and writers from various countries have already sent their signatures in protest against the Swedish state’s failure to find an appropriate form of economic security. Jean Sellem believes that he is not only speaking for himself but for all artists who reject the idea of becoming civil servants or art dealers. I would be grateful if you too would sign the enclosed petition.

The exhibition consists of three parts that connect the viewer with photographs in such a way that, when experienced together, they create a geometric “sculpture.” Naturally, the “sculptures” exist only when the viewer observes the photographs in the manner proposed by Michael Crane. The “sculptures,” therefore, exist only on an intellectual level — and only for as long as each viewer allows them to exist. The exhibition also presents a book, “Fill in this space”, which contains a collection of 26 conceptual works by Michael Crane produced over the past four years. Most of the book deals with formal and/or intuitive questions concerning things he perceives to exist around him. Michael Crane states: “I remain constantly fascinated and curious about the forces in my surroundings that affect me, as well as about my own reactions to the environment and the ways in which I assimilate these experiences.The results of these assimilations are presented in this exhibition.As an artist, I wish to communicate, and I therefore chose to do so in such a way that the viewer can insert the missing information or simply imagine the possibilities.” The exhibition is open weekdays 3 p.m.–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12 p.m.–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:d65742c709:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/michel-dansel","title":"MICHEL DANSEL | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MICHEL DANSEL — ACADÉMIE INTERNATIONALE DU RAT — 15-28.02.1977 MICHEL DANSELACADÉMIE INTERNATIONALE DU RAT15-28.02.1977 “If the rat weighed 20 kilos more, man would no longer be the ruler of the Earth.”Einstein The Académie Internationale du Rat (International Academy of the Rat) visits Galerie S:t Petri in Lund from February 15 to 28, 1977.The president of the Academy is Michel Dansel. The aim is to gather as much documentation as possible about this much-discussed rodent. Michel Dansel from Paris is a writer, poet, and literary critic. He has published his own poetic works, as well as studies on mainly 19th-century French symbolist poets such as Laforgue, Corbière, and Verlaine. Last year, he published a remarkable and much-debated book about the Parisian cemetery Père Lachaise, for which he also received the annual prize for black humor. Recently, Michel Dansel published the book Our Brothers the Rats – Their History, Legends, Mysteries, and the Art of Loving Them. It is based on extensive documentary material about the role the rat has played in all societies, throughout all times, and across various humanistic disciplines. For some time, Dansel has also published the periodical RATTUS, which is part of his Académie Internationale du Rat.In RATTUS, articles and documents about the rat are presented from literary, documentary, historical, artistic, and iconographic perspectives. The various contributors include doctors, scientists, and artists from many parts of the world. “The rats,” says Michel Dansel, “are victims of our prejudices, our dogmatic thinking, and our lack of curiosity. Yet they continue to fascinate us intensely. The rat exists in our dreams, in our unconscious; it is the laboratory animal of science, humanity, and progress. We should,” he argues, “be aware of the rat’s refined intelligence, social structure, and mystique — these animals, in many ways, could have taken over the helm.” The president of the Académie Internationale du Rat hopes that the exhibition in Lund will establish contact with Swedish rat researchers. The exhibition is open on weekdays from 15:00 to 20:00, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 to 17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:708821e8f2:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/moder-jord","title":"MODER JORD | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"MODER JORD — (ECOLOGICAL FARM) — 20 - 24.08.1979 MODER JORD(ECOLOGICAL FARM)20 - 24.08.1979 (Text printed on the exhibition poster) During the period 20-24 August 1979 the idea laboratory Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, Sweden, was transformed into a vegetarian restaurant.

In Western society, human material existence has long been built up, but the spiritual side of life has often been forgotten. Among many contemporary artists, one finds a search for values beyond the material. At Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, Motti Mizrachi from Israel presents large photographs whose symbolism has roots in both Zen Buddhism and Kabbalistic mysticism. His early works were filled with chaos, destructiveness, and a longing for death. He saw life as a path of suffering (Via Dolorosa). The body served as a metaphor to illustrate the possibilities of life. In his later works, light has come to play an important role. Light as spiritual energy forms the basis in, for example, Neoplatonism, Jewish Kabbalah, and Zen Buddhism. The photographs shown at Galerie S:t Petri are contemplative images—urging the viewer toward stillness and reflection. Mizrachi often uses seemingly irrelevant objects in his works, referring again to Zen Buddhism, where what appears “meaningless” may seem confusing but whose task is to create concrete and intuitive knowledge of what cannot be attained through conventional learning. For Motti Mizrachi, art is the same as a way of life. The exhibition runs until November 15, 1978.

The works of Nathalie Talec, Fanny Volatier, and Paul-Armand Gette from France reflect on different aspects of this phenomenon. It is a very complex network of circumstances that determines how the artist/model relationship is formed, and therefore it is also difficult to analyse. The artist has a certain intention, and the model is used mainly as an element — a part — to visualize this intention. In this sense, the model acquires significance as a contrast effect: distance and closeness are two related concepts that can be visualized through models. The viewer interprets the work from their own perspective. Perception is not independent of how an individual feels or thinks, but is influenced by the personal tones of personality. Thus, the viewer may misread the artist’s intended solution and see something entirely different. When the artist/model relationship touches upon a “forbidden” area for the viewer, the reaction may be to accuse the artist for the choice of subject matter, rather than recognizing the viewer’s own emotional involvement in the interpretation. In these three exhibitions, clothing plays an important role. The artists identify with different figures — the artist themselves, a friend, a mother, a child — and relate to the proximity or distance between the artist and the imaginary model. Everything is presented fragmentarily, with a poetic undertone. The works are rich in associations and cryptic — through small belongings or notes of memory, we can sense the closeness of another person and experience her intensely for a brief moment. In part, and yet as a whole. The exhibition runs until May 17, 1980.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:afa2d61744:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/neon-de-suro","title":"NEON DE SURO | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"NEON DE SURO — GRUPE DE TREBALL — ITS BETTER IN THE FICTION NEON DE SUROGRUPE DE TREBALLITS BETTER IN THE FICTION28.04- 10.05.1978 Mallorca — the Scandinavian summer paradise. One associates it with sun and swimming, crowded beaches.But there is also another side, one that is not often noticed by the tourists — namely, the life of the Mallorcans themselves. A glimpse of what is beginning to emerge among some of the island’s inhabitants is presented by the artist group Neon de Suro at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, from April 28 to May 10, 1978. According to Neon de Suro, truly creative art cannot be separated from the environment in which it is created.Mallorca is an island, and this has meant a certain isolation.Its geographical position in the Mediterranean has also caused it, for centuries, to be exposed to foreign domination. Tourism has likewise brought many negative consequences.Throughout history, it has been marked by dependency — economically and culturally.It is this cultural lack of independence that Neon de Suro seeks to overcome. Neon de Suro is both an artists’ collective and a magazine.Neon stands for artificial light and aggressiveness within the technological consumer society.Suro denotes something obscure, known for decades in Catalan culture.The traditional and the contemporary are woven together — this synthesis forms the starting point of Neon de Suro’s work. The magazine Neon de Suro serves as a megaphone for younger artists.Each issue is a work in itself.The printing technique is free, the format likewise.What unites every issue is simplicity and a lack of pretension.The drawings in the magazine are often comic-like, and there is a constant struggle against old myths.Should the group ever face opponents, they would fight them with their own triumphs — for everything must always be questioned.This is the principle behind Neon de Suro. For the Lund exhibition, Neon de Suro and Galerie S:t Petri are releasing an issue of the magazine.On the first page, a sheep is shown — one soon to be slaughtered.Inside, readers are encouraged to travel to the Bahamas instead of Mallorca — “because it’s so much better there.”Or perhaps this is the realm of imagination?Many claim that the fantastic figures in the publication communicate by shouting “Absolute!”On the last page, the classic situation familiar to all bathers is shown: people on the beach and in the water, packed together like sardines in a can. One of Neon de Suro’s members, Sara Gibert, is expected to come to Lund for the exhibition, which is open on weekdays from 15:00 to 20:00, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 13:00 to 17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:13f31290f8:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/new-eter","title":"NEW ETER | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"NEW ETER — LA CAMPAGNE — 17 - 23.08.1973 NEW ETERLA CAMPAGNE17 - 23.08.1973 LA CAMPAGNE The studies for la campagne (the countryside), carried out by Paul-Armand Gette, began in 1971 in Käglinge and were completed this year.

Political tensions run high. We can read about them in the newspapers and hear about them on radio and television. Naturally, Italian artists have also been drawn into these discussions regarding the permanence of the current social order compared with other systems that might be considered better. A glimpse of this issue can be seen in the three current exhibitions at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund. Fernando De Filippi, Nicole Gravier, and the magazine TRA from Italy present their views on the artist’s role in a society such as the Italian one. One of the main goals for artists, according to them, is to be able to feel part of a collective unit. To achieve this, one must understand the ideological conditions of the country and take a position either for or against them. The artist should avoid isolation, avoid placing themselves outside of reality and social interaction. Otherwise, there is a risk of being forced into acting within boundaries where art itself becomes purely ornamental. In one issue of TRA, the theme “Art as Ideology” is discussed. It states, among other things, that humanity needs alternative models to those currently existing within a given system. There must always be the possibility of revising any system — whether in the East or the West. For De Filippi, Gravier, and TRA, the current Italian social system is of such a nature that it must be questioned. Fernando De Filippi works with language in the form of slogans borrowed from texts related to art and politics. He places these various slogans everywhere — in subways, on squares, and in public spaces. He uses different languages simultaneously and sets them in contexts where their original meaning sometimes becomes its opposite. Nicole Gravier is primarily concerned with mapping myths and clichés in art and television. She creates series of color images of phenomena from both fields to highlight their “sacredness.” TRA, the magazine, focuses mainly on placing art within a social and societal perspective. Its emphasis on the collective often comes at the expense of the individual. For this reason, it also welcomes viewpoints from scientists in various social-scientific disciplines.

Instead, a number of additional rules have been introduced, making it easy for more institutions to emerge. It is no longer the human being who determines movements and ways of acting; the rules now govern almost all behavior. Mr. Klein is a person placed within the total institution. The starting point of the project is a correspondence. The letters have been formalized into a form-book — our era’s organizational writing. The forms are designed in such a way that they allow only for responses considered desirable in advance. The human being herself has become irrelevant. The vision of the project is a person’s journey through a hotel, his encounter with things and concepts, and how he relates to them. Niels Lomholt and Tom Elling have used a technique corresponding to cinematic montage. The scattered experiences are cut together into a new continuity and acquire new meaning. Mr. Klein is no longer a human being, but the total sum of certain conditions, through which one can maneuver away from the outer world. The exhibition is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 13:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:99aa8efde0:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/niels-viggo-bentzon","title":"NIELS VIGGO BENTZON | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"NIELS VIGGO BENTZON — KONCERT MED VERTE AF — 01 -13.02. 1974 NIELS VIGGO BENTZONKONCERT MED VERTE AF01 -13.02. 1974 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund – sweden046 / 14 78 00The Danish composer Niels Viggo Bentzon is exhibiting manuscripts and drawings for various hypothetical projects at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, during the period February 1–13, 1974.Niels Viggo Bentzon began his studies in theory, piano, and organ in 1938 at the Royal Danish Conservatory in Copenhagen.

Oey was originally a pharmacist by profession, but for thirty years he has devoted himself to artistic practice. A few years ago he left the profession of pharmacy and has since then devoted himself exclusively to art. For him, art is a part of life — a way of breathing. The exhibition deals with the things that surround us and that tend to become our enemies. Among other things, we see a chair on which a pile of newspapers has been tied with rope; a number of sawn-off objects fitted with half-open zippers; a box of stones featuring mirror-reversed letters, which can be read in the mirror placed behind; a box of plaster in whose centre a nail was driven while the plaster was still soft, forming rings that then hardened. Oey himself is present during the exhibition and on Wednesday at 18:00 he shows two series of slides. One is the result of a collaboration with the German artist Thomas Niggl. It concerns an action in which the entire façade of Oey’s former pharmacy is covered with newspaper and ends with the German artist transforming into a kind of living papier-mâché sculpture. In the second series we see a cage full of crumpled paper balls that the artist sets on fire. They form a sculpture that exists for four minutes and then disappears.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:4f8c96f156:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/oliver-weerasinghe","title":"03-23.09.1971 OLIVER WEERASINGHE","content":"OLIVER WEERASINGHE — SKULPTUR — 03-23.09.1971 OLIVER WEERASINGHESKULPTUR03-23.09.1971 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund OLIVER WEERASINGHE - sculptor (1933 Colombo Ceylon)3 september - 23 september 1971 \" A sculpture must have its own life..

Since 1969, he has collected old advertising material — mostly enameled advertising signs, but also other types of signs, labels, packaging, and quite a few advertisements. The purpose of the exhibition is to shed light on some of the concepts and methods of advertising, seen from a historical perspective. Even though newer advertising is more sophisticated in its design and therefore more difficult to see through, the arguments and the underlying morality are largely the same. Although the relatively limited material cannot provide a broad overview of different arguments and methods, the exhibition may still offer some insight into the ways advertising operates.Since most of the material is from before the 1960s, the analysis becomes simpler and the images clearer. The exhibition does not claim to present a comprehensive “history of advertising.” The scarcity of works and the lack of research and factual data are striking. For that reason, Olle Næssle is very interested in getting in touch with anyone who has viewpoints or material related to the history of our most widely circulated messages. On Saturday, December 21, at 6 p.m., Olle Næssle will talk about his collection. The exhibition is open throughout the Christmas and New Year holidays until January 8, 1975.Opening hours: weekdays 3–8 p.m., weekends 12–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:a1f64d5871:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/oscar-reutersvard","title":"OSCAR REUTERSVÄRD | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"OSCAR REUTERSVARD — EROTISKA EGYPTISKA GUDAMYTER — 07 -18.06.1975 OSCAR REUTERSVARDEROTISKA EGYPTISKA GUDAMYTER07 -18.06.1975 PRESS VIEWING — FRIDAY, JUNE 6, AT 11:30 AM Egyptian Deities Erotized by Professor Oscar Reutersvärd of the Department of Art History, Lund University, is exhibited at Galerie S:t Petri as spiritual and material support for the gallery’s activities. In about fifty ink drawings, we are told of a multitude of divine beings entangled in strange adventures. Among Professor Reutersvärd’s special areas of study is the examination of phallic symbolism in 18th-century architecture and its references to buildings alluding to the phallus in antiquity.Furthermore, he has devoted himself to ancient mythology, especially those divine legends with erotic themes, where, among other things, the sperm and the erect male organ play a central role as symbols of spiritual and abstract forces. Striking are Oscar Reutersvärd’s profound knowledge of eroticism in Egyptian mythology and his skillful visual recreation of these stories — all the more remarkable considering that the professor has never set foot in Egypt. The theme of this exhibition should be perceived differently today than, for example, during the Erotic Art Exhibition at Lunds Konsthall in 1968.The development of conceptual art in Sweden over the past few years has, to some extent, already changed our way of seeing and interpreting such images.Experience with other artistic means of expression during the past seven years — body art, performance, semiotics, photo sequences, etc. — has expanded our perceptual and associative abilities.Oscar Reutersvärd’s images are symptomatic of such a broadened vision. Some of the drawings, kindly donated by Professor Reutersvärd to Galerie S:t Petri for its experimental activities, have previously been shown in larger contexts, including at Lunds Konsthall and Galerie Heland in Stockholm.In the autumn, an edition of drawings and texts by Oscar Reutersvärd about Egyptian mythological figures will be published as a book.

Dear Professors and Doctors of Mathematics!Dear Ladies! Dear Gentlemen! Despite the definition by the German mathematician Ferdinand Lindemann (1882), that the mathematical quantity designated by pi, later called the Ludolphine number, represents the result of the calculation of the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, the search for its final value has not ceased. Even if, contrary to the prevailing scientific opinion, you believe in a rational value as the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle, and perhaps even find no peace over the problem, you are hereby cordially invited to an open discussion. I would like to convince you with the rational value 3.1415926535928, discovered by me on 1 October 1976, that the circle number pi is rational. It was discovered 2,476 years after Pythagoras and 2,188 years after Archimedes. Ten Pythagorean number triples and the Ludolphine number as a lower limit led to the discovery of the “truth,” which had eluded discovery for so long. Between the number 3.1415926535928 and the so-called Ludolphine number there is a difference of 3 billionths, and the circumference of the Earth calculated with it is 39/1000 mm larger than when calculated with the Ludolphine number. I am prepared to provide proof and expect only understanding, openness, and an unbiased reception. I am ready to ensure that no doubt remains concerning the correctness of the discovered “truth.” Should it turn out that you agree with me that the “truth” has now become evident, then logically the terms “incommensurable, irrational, and transcendental” in connection with the concept “circle number” are obsolete and belong to the past. In the interest of the science of mathematics, it would be desirable if the discussion resulted in confirmation or in proof of error. All participants are invited to form their own opinions through the discovery. Quotations from existing literature can serve as comparative assessments. I hope for an open-minded discussion and look forward to welcoming you, as seekers of confirmation.

It deals with exotic trees, bushes, and flowers from North America, Africa, and Asia that have been planted in Paris and Malmö and have completely blended into the European environment — into the Parisian or Malmö landscape. In this way, the exotic has also become banal. Jean-Jacques Rousseau already considered it absurd to bring plants from India or China to be planted in Paris. The attitude that something is better simply because it comes from far away and does not actually belong in the local climate, he regarded as mistaken. So does Paul-Armand Gette. With the help of photographs and photocopies of plants long believed to belong to the local flora, he points to all the exotic plants that exist right next to us. Even the most stereotypical of all exotic plants — the palm — is represented by a photograph from the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris. Paul-Armand Gette is interested in two aspects: partly people’s ideas of what is exotic, and partly in the strict sense of the word — that which is not native but imported. For more than twenty years, Paul-Armand Gette has devoted himself to artistic exploration of his surroundings. Landscapes, lakes, and forests have played an important role in his studies. “Paul-Armand Gette’s work subtly rejects science as absolute truth as well as aestheticism. Instead, he uses science as an instrument for intellectual and spiritual reflection,” writes Jean Sellem (see below) in his introduction to Gette’s retrospective exhibition at Malmö Konsthall, which opened last Saturday. Galerie S:t Petri is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 13:00–17:00. The exhibition Exotism as Banality runs until 29 February 1980. Paul-Armand Gette’s plastic study is above all a poetic attempt to merge ethics and aesthetics into a single unity. By ethics is meant here the system of rules that ensures the existence of beings and things within a defined environment (milieu restreint). In the same way, aesthetics refers to the harmony and complete functional purposefulness of nature. On all levels, this study has a decisive significance for the spiritual and physical development of human beings. It concerns in some way orienting the creative human (le plasticien) toward a humanization of form and thought. The goal of Gette’s seemingly formalistic study is not utopian. He has set out, neither more nor less, to show explicitly that all transformations are bound to the concepts of time and space. This again raises the fundamental problem of the fourth dimension, discovered through Einstein’s triumphant theory of relativity and ideas of hypergeometry at the beginning of the century. Paul-Armand Gette’s work asserts, as a continuation, an intellectual, moral, and artistic attitude for contemporary humanity, especially in relation to the environment. It presupposes the unexpected coordination between time and space. Moreover, it is polemical through unshakable logic and a priori reasoning. One may say that it unites the psychic and the physical worlds, taking a first step toward a new line of development that may be leading for advanced industrial society as well as for all other societies. Paul-Armand Gette’s work subtly rejects science as an absolute truth as well as aestheticism. Instead, he uses science as an instrument for intellectual and spiritual reflection.

Last year and in 1972 Galerie S:t Petri presented similar short exhibitions by Paul-Armand Gette, “La campagne” and “Ringsjön” respectively—the gallery wishes, after all, to follow certain experimental artists’ “investigations.” The exhibition is open on weekdays from 3 pm to 8 pm.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ed63981cf5:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/paul-kiraly","title":"18.02 - 08.03.1972 PAUL KIRALY","content":"PAUL KIRALY — SKULPTUR — 18.02 - 08.03.1972 PAUL KIRALYSKULPTUR18.02 - 08.03.1972 galerie s:t petris:t petri kyrkogata 5lund PAUL KIRALY – sculptor18 February – 8 March 1972 \"It may seem that our century far surpasses its predecessors in the production of visual art – quantitatively; the supply of images is enormous.In today’s art life, it is an almost hopeless task to evoke any response from the saturated public; visual art has in many cases become a Mesopotamian language for the uninitiated.But to draw from this the conclusion that the representational image is the only true art form, accessible and comprehensible to all, may be a crude sort of mistake. In the situation where a strong equivalence for all forms of art prevails, there are forces which see their opportunities, mastering opinion via mass media, often ensuring that a certain political message comes through carefully constructed channels. The direction is not hard to discern; the ordinary observer can and should not seldom receive a stimulus for thought. Problematic: Form:– What is the prerequisite for the mammal’s swelling form?– Can something similar to the mammal’s form be achieved through plasma, i.e., solid matter + liquid?– Does color play any role in this context?

At Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, he is now showing — for the first time in Sweden — “Crazy Design”, setting it in contrast, for example, to industrial design, where everything is arranged and regulated according to specific rules and norms. In Crazy Design, there is always room for coincidence. Paul Freisler uses various things, ideas, and materials. The aspect of time has great significance in his creation. He has now existed for 37 years, and in this exhibition, one can take part in a small fragment of his life, his time. Then it is over. And life, time, continues to pulse until he once again pauses for a moment, looks around, and lets us as spectators share in his observations. Since 1971, Paul Freisler has been greatly interested in science. To some extent, he laughs at the way scientific disciplines operate. The regularity, the professional routine, quantification — none of this is for him. His artistic activity is a form of research where thoughts and experiences from earlier decades are not rejected, but rather where developments based on them are considered most important. This happens best when we place ourselves outside the rules of the game, observing what takes place in time and trying to do something else with it. Paul Freisler wants us to look at familiar things in a different way. Thus, for example, he paints pink dots on sugar cubes and places them in peculiar settings, which signals that sugar can be perceived in several ways — not just as something we use for our coffee or tea. Paul Freisler always has an exhibition in his pocket — he is always ready to step outside and see things anew, to rethink, to question the rules, the norms, the usual ways of behaving. On Saturday, March 8 at 6 p.m., he will perform an action in the gallery. The exhibition runs from March 5 to 17, 1980, and is open weekdays 15:00–20:00, Saturdays and Sundays 13:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:3cf0224677:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/paul-woodrow","title":"PAUL WOODROW | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"PAUL WOODROW — IMAGINAIR TRAVEL SERVICE — FLY TO WHERE YOU ARE PAUL WOODROWIMAGINAIR TRAVEL SERVICEFLY TO WHERE YOU ARE11.06-20.06.1979 (Text printed on the exhibition poster) IMAGINAIR TRAVEL SERVICE ‘Fly to where you are’ The journey is never merely a passage through time and space, but rather an expression of the urgent desire for change and self-discovery that underlies the actual movement and experience of travelling. Hence, to seek, to enquire, or to live with intensity through profound experiences are all modes of travelling, or the symbolic equivalent of the journey. Travelling is an IMAGE of aspiration, or an unsatisfied longing that never finds its goal, see where it may. Day dreaming and acts of the imagination can be equated with travelling. Travelling may also be related to the complete cycle of the year or to the attempt to escape from it, depending on certain secondary characteristics of the Journey. The true journey is neither acquiescence or escape, it is EVOLUTION. The ordeals of a journey are like the rites of passage. The archetype of the journey is the pilgrimage to the ‘centre’ or the way out of the ‘maze’. Flying implies raising oneself, and is therefore closely connected with the symbolism of level, possibly in terms of mastery in such qualities as strength. “…of all metaphors, on those pertaining to height, ascent, depth, descent and fall are axiomatic. Nothing can explain them, but they can explain everything.” — Gaston Bachelard “Freedom gained by travel is no substitute for true inner liberation.” “The need for change may be filled temporarily by a trip around the world, or by nothing more than a move to a smaller house. But none of these external changes will serve unless there has been some inner transcendence of values, in creating, not just surviving, a new pattern of life.” — C.G. Jung “We shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.” — T.S. Eliot The Imaginair Travel Service gives assistance to people who intend to Participate in ‘flights of imagination’, with the purpose of coming to an understanding about the nature of the journey and its implications for everyday life.

Thus, a museum makes a statement about something and not simply about what is immediately displayed. There is nevertheless much in recent thinking about museums which is ahistorical, attempting for so-called pedagogical reasons to divorce itself from history. Considered more deeply, the pedagogics here are highly reactionary and constitute an unsound mode of thought, however good their intentions. To contemplate without reference to history is like using a spade without a shaft. Terrible things have occurred in recent years, it seems to me, under the name of modernizing museums. The same is happening in the world of art in general, i.e. in the promotion of major international art tendencies. The real creators here are those arranging for exhibitions and it is actually their creations which are being shown. Artists whose work are chosen for the degree to which these fit into the overall picture sought by the arranger serve simply as elements. The result is one of small diverse units without historical background, so that real meaning or statement is lacking. Fluxus represented the most significant development since the War. It involved simplicity and a way of saying simple things. Much of that which has come since, as in conceptual art for example, possesses quite the opposite of simplicity, having little or no meaning and being executed in an empty and pompous style. If methods and materials are reduced to pure demonstrations, they are without interest. Fluxus always involved and was something definite, which a museum in its true sense is as well.\"","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:38107f238a:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/peter-mandrup-hansen","title":"PETER MANDRUP HANSEN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"PETER MANDRUP HANSEN — 04 - 12.01.1977 PETER MANDRUP HANSEN04 - 12.01.1977 PETER MANDRUP HANSEN from Denmark exhibits paintings and drawings at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, from January 4 to 12, 1977. His works are expressions of states of mind but at the same time give rise to a physical response caused by the colours and the vibrations of the brushstrokes. The existential problem they pose is both obscure and clear.His professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, Richard Mortensen, writes in his introduction to the exhibition: “The clarity is so evident in the last series I have seen. The monochrome ground of the painting is treated with his brush writing, which follows the classic rules of automatic writing. A few staccato, elongated forms emerge and detach themselves from the background, giving rise to a dynamic rhythm, a musicality of movement — a mystical stillness, like that of a river flowing from land to sea.” Peter Mandrup Hansen seeks in his paintings to capture the very act of creation, the instant of becoming. He employs a visual language that demands our attention and challenges our ability to experience contemplative and meditative awareness. On Saturday, January 8, beginning at 6 p.m., Peter Mandrup Hansen will create a painting at Galerie S:t Petri. The public will also have the opportunity to ask questions.

Other collaborations include “The Phantom’s Secret Life” (1962), “Dear NN” (1966), “To See Film” (1970), and “The Authors and the Film” (1970). Peter Ortman came to Lund in 1961, became editor of Vox in 1964, and in the same year took a post at the Department of Comparative Literature with a focus mainly on film and modern poetry.

Meyer12.02-18.02.1979 During the week of February 12–18, 1979, Galerie S:t Petri in Lund is organizing a radio play week featuring works by Guillaume Apollinaire, Samuel Beckett, Peter R. Meyer, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Vilgot Sjöman, and Alexander Weiss. Peter R. Meyer, from Stockholm, has directed all eight radio plays and believes that the time has come to present radio drama as an independent dramatic form. According to Peter Meyer, the broadcast media are today one of the main factors shaping social development. Its pedagogical potential and its function as a means of communication are significant. Through this medium, he hopes to be able to convey his ideas on art and culture in a way that helps to broaden and deepen our view of reality, which is often dominated by a materialistic worldview. For Meyer, it is important to restore a spiritual perspective to existence. The value of art, he argues, is determined by its spiritual content. Technological civilization has led to human isolation. Only when the outer limits of science merge with the ideas of mysticism and religion will a new era of understanding begin, says Peter Meyer. Peter R. Meyer is currently preparing his first feature film. For several years, he has worked as a freelance director and producer, including for Swedish Radio in Stockholm. He has also traveled widely as a radio producer in Japan, Thailand, Nepal, Poland, the West Indies, and several other countries. In connection with the broadcast of Guillaume Apollinaire’s “Tiresias’ Breasts”, Margareth Wijk, who is writing her doctoral dissertation on Apollinaire, will present his “L’Esprit Nouveau” on Tuesday, February 13, at 6 p.m. Each day at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., two different radio plays will be performed.

Phil Berkman has been working with experimental art since the early 1970s.In various manifestations in the USA and South America, he has presented his ideas through different new media — the same media that many Western artists use today — such as video, photography, film, and performance.At the Lund exhibition, his work is presented in the form of photographs, including pieces he calls “Identity Reduction”, “TV News for the Deaf”, “Artist/Critic”, and “Not Nostalgically Remembered” — the latter referring to President Nixon. About his view on art, Phil Berkman writes: “We are surprised by a visiting friend, perhaps foreign to our culture, who sees people, the city, customs, etc., from another perspective.I believe the artist is like this stranger, but without having to leave his world.He creates his own rituals based on the need for rituals; he can show the illusory act of looking without seeing and finds everywhere opportunities for new perceptions. Mundane and everyday things, actions, and rituals play a role in a world where their meaning or meaninglessness is often overlooked.These ‘small mirrors’ reflect our physical and psychological environment.My works are about examining the many nuances of seemingly simple things, and the closer they come to real-life situations — without imitating them — the better.The difference is what makes it my art.” The exhibition is open on weekdays 15:00–20:00,and on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays 12:00–17:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:5cd2a6ed3a:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/phil-berkman-john-dedomenico-carl-johnson-john-spray","title":"PHIL BERKMAN JOHN DEDOMENICO CARL JOHNSON JOHN SPRAY | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"LOW-EGO — DISPLAY MATERIAL — (No Commercial Value) LOW-EGODISPLAY MATERIAL(No Commercial Value)15.03 - 15.04.1978 PHIL BERKMAN JOHN DEDOMENICOCARL JOHNSONJOHN SPRAY The American society, with all that it implies — hopes, possibilities, limitations, and disappointments — constitutes the starting point, consciously or unconsciously, for Phil Berkman, John De Domenico, Carl Johnson, and John Spray.These four artists, all based in the United States, were invited by Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, and their works are being presented at the Department of Art History, third floor of the University Building (display material). “Low-ego”, display material (“no commercial value”) is the title of the exhibition, which primarily concerns how human beings confront their environment — how they are shaped by it and/or reshape it. Psychological, sociological, and anthropological aspects of human life intertwine, becoming equally significant and hardly separable.This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by John De Domenico, whose “SOM-OM” works revolve around anthropological and sociological theories on how the human body and its structure function as instruments of communication through which ideas, language, and culture emerge and evolve further — in the form of analogies and comparisons. “SOM-OM” symbolically depicts certain “things” with a specific cultural meaning, showing how they are “adapted” to human gestures and expressions — or conversely, how the body adjusts itself to the “thing.” Thus, human beings are faced with a choice: to yield to the demands of their environment and adopt its attitudes, or to influence the surrounding world themselves. As humans are both individual and social beings, these dual processes are in constant motion — the question is simply which one predominates. John Spray emigrated from England to the United States five years ago. The encounter with American culture — its “Wild West” law-and-order ethic, violence, and sensationalism — was a shock that he has not yet overcome. His thought-provoking series of police photographs taken from various American newspapers conveys a sense of hopelessness in the face of seemingly insoluble problems. Carl Johnson is primarily concerned with understanding how a decision is made. What makes each of us choose, what lies behind it, what are our motives and intentions? Why do we like some things and dislike others? On “American Lunch Bags” appear statements such as: “I like anything,” “I like something,” “I like everything.”According to Johnson, these subjective choices have certain causes; he delves deeper into them. “Countries” shift from landscape to memory-images of ideas. We think politically as well as geographically. Units are formed out of landscape — in alphabetical order. But even if the lines remain, the references change, and we associate differently. Phil Berkman likes to play with functional objects or wants the spectator to participate in a metaphorical performance, as in “The Shadow Play.” In “Why Dance?” he also explores dimensions such as activity/passivity and emotion/intellect. The exhibition is open from March 15 to April 15, 1978, weekdays from 9:00 to 15:30.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:9009b033ef:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/philip-anderson","title":"PHILIP ANDERSON | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"PHILIP ANDERSON — VISIONARY WORLDS — 14.10.1978 PHILIP ANDERSONVISIONARY WORLDS14.10.1978","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:2c5e13ff5d:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/philosophical-workshop","title":"PHILOSOPHICAL WORKSHOP | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"PHILOSOPHICAL WORKSHOP POSTER — 08.10 - 12.11.1980 PHILOSOPHICAL WORKSHOP POSTER08.10 - 12.11.1980 Text extracted from the poster: 08.10 – 12.11.1980 PHILOSOPHICAL WORKSHOP Participants: 8 Oct.

As an expression of this friendship, and in light of the gallery’s long-standing interest in the new directions emerging in contemporary Danish art, Galerie S:t Petri now presents a retrospective exhibition of Daner Gallery’s activities since its inception. The Danish constructivist Jane Pedersen, who for several years has followed the development of Daner Gallery, writes in a letter to Galerie S:t Petri: “By alternating between Danish and foreign visual artists, Daner Gallery has helped initiate a dialogue and fostered mutual influence. At times, the Daner Gallery has also functioned as a kind of laboratory, where a new idea can be tested before being presented in a larger context. Or, it has simply not been used for exhibitions at all — as was said, this is not where things ‘take place’.It has represented a negation of art as an isolated phenomenon, a constant reference to art as an integrated part of everyday life — where one begins and ends by talking about art, because everything that concerns human beings and everything that touches us is art. That is why we are all image-makers.” The exhibition runs from March 8 to 20, 1974.The gallery is open weekdays 3–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays 12–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:55956f4376:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/poul-skelbye","title":"POUL SKELBYE | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"POUL SKELBYE — 09- 28.03.1973 POUL SKELBYE09- 28.03.1973 Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5Lund046/14 78 00 Poul Skelbye exhibits paintings during the period 9–28 March 1973at Galerie S:t Petri, Lund.He was born in Denmark in 1919 and studied, among other things, architecturein Copenhagen.In the early 1940s, he debuted as a painter.

In their home country, the group has performed at Speaker’s Corner, in theatres, libraries, dance studios, universities, and various galleries. The restrained action characterizes most of the group’s performances. The impossibility of carrying out a simple activity without hindrance becomes evident in these performances. The obstructing factor may be either the performer themself — for instance, wrapped in ropes attempting to perform everyday tasks — or one or several other people.

Tom Puckey, one of the members of Reindeer Werk, describes some of the situations one can find oneself in as follows: “With my eyes bound, I try to cut up meat and arrange the pieces in a straight line. I run around in a costume covered with sacks filled with objects, and I am in a hurry. I mark my own movements by blowing a whistle. I lie down in the street, crawl, drag myself forward. I measure the progress of a snail and follow its pace.” Tom Puckey means, in other words, that it is by no means as easy as one might think — to move, to speak, to eat, to drink, and so on. Through their actions, the members of Reindeer Werk aim to make us aware of the many mental and practical circumstances that act as brakes on our capacity for action, even in the simplest everyday situations.

His philosophy is called Art One/One and aims, among other things, to make people see their surroundings and themselves as a whole, to become aware of their responsibility. Art One/One stands for a well-balanced use of the discoveries of modern science, while at the same time being aware that science provides us only with an image of reality, not the whole of reality. Man should be given the possibility to regain his faith in himself, to dream, to improvise, and to be independent. Art One/One has since been further developed. Jean Sellem wrote the first part two years ago together with Dr. David Weston on, among other things, alienation. The third and fourth parts of the philosophy were completed in 1979. The four sections of Art One/One form the basis for Robin Crozier’s exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri. He has read and studied the texts and visualized them. Above all, he has based his work on Art One/One III, which deals with reflections on art as thought and thinking as art. To gain a deeper understanding of an artwork—or of an object in general—it is, according to Art One/One, important to be able to imagine it in its natural surroundings, its espace ambiant, and at the same time to reflect on how human living conditions would be in a world where the object in question would serve as an ethical and aesthetic model. To make his ideas clearer, Jean Sellem has used an abstract form — the cube — and with its help explains how we can perceive the surrounding world and ourselves. Art One/One regards an arbitrary, drawn, motionless cube from four different points of view:I) The cube’s form tends primarily toward an outgoing movement (explosion)II) The cube’s form tends primarily toward an ingoing movement (implosion)III) The cube’s form tends primarily toward stillness (statics)IV) The cube’s form tends to express a trinity between the outgoing, ingoing, and static (unity) The gallery’s remaining rooms are thus devoted to these four key concepts: explosion (room 2), implosion (room 3), statics (room 4), and unity (room 5). The exhibition runs from December 1 to 15, 1979, and is open weekdays from 3–8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 1–5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:f8c53968d9:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/roland-vila-pierre-guillet-de-monthoux","title":"ROLAND VILA PIERRE GUILLET DE MONTHOUX | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ROLAND VILA — PIERRE GUILLET DE MONTHOUX — PRESENT THEIR BOOK WRITTEN N 24 HOURS.

(046) 14 78 00 Thinking, work, and life cannot be separated from one another, says RUTH WOLF-REHFELDT from the GDR and current exhibitor at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund. Life is a kind of thinking, subjective thinking, and being an artist is something that everyone is or could be. Artistic practice is, for oneself, to set up more or less aesthetically structured signs with a certain subjective meaning. But she does not agree with some artists who believe that life is the same as art. A certain way of thinking, a certain structuring of life, is necessary in order to create art. Ideally, she would have preferred to limit her activities to being solely thoughts, something taking place within herself. But ideas cannot only accumulate in the mind; they must reach a form through which she can be confronted with them and orient herself later. It is not enough to passively feel, think, hear—some immediately tangible sign, trace, or form of the idea must be created. Ruth Wolf-Rehfeldt has been active as an artist since the early 1960s. In the beginning she devoted herself primarily to painting, drawing, collage. But already in 1963 writing—in the form of various language materials, diaries, poetry, word series—became her main form of expression. Since 1972 her concrete or visual poetry has been expressed largely in typewritten texts/images. Most of these works are in a small format as her artistic activities have mostly taken place via Mail Art. That form—sending via the post office in East Berlin to communicate with various artists around the world—has suited her well. At S:t Petri fragments of her artistic practice are shown—both individual works and works created together with other Mail Art artists. Galerie S:t Petri regrets that Ruth Wolf-Rehfeldt and her husband Robert Rehfeldt, who both had been invited to come to Lund, were not allowed to attend the exhibition in person. S:t Petri is open weekdays 15–20, Saturdays 13–17. The exhibition runs from 10–20 June 1981. NON-COMMERCIAL ART LABORATORY FOUNDED IN 1971.

Therefore, we want to try to keep the relief work going during the Christmas holidays, so that the help for the many needy Polish children will not fail to reach them despite the general Christmas celebrations in Sweden. We make use of the aid organisation that already exists in the Lund area – Solidarity with the Children of Poland – which has direct contact with the Association of Friends of Children (TPD) in Warsaw. Our activity in the gallery, which in the name of humanity has been made available to us by Jean Sellem during the Christmas holiday, is aimed at those who during this festive time want to feel the joy of sharing some of their prosperity and come in to us one of these Christmas days to talk a little, drink coffee, and feel free to ask questions about Poland which many are discussing today. We show photos from Poland, children’s drawings made by Polish children, and other items connected with Poland that we have collected. During the Christmas holidays there will always be at least two of us at the gallery, so that we can receive your gifts and ensure the aid is properly delivered. For the children we plan to arrange some small pleasant activities with games, painting, singing, storytelling, juice and gingerbread.

To receive or not receive an official stamp from an authority can mean a struggle between life and death. When artists use stamps, however, the meaning is the direct opposite. They ironize over seriousness, authority, and power embodied in the official stamp. Instead, playfulness and humor are emphasized. An example of stamp art by about fifty artists from different countries can be seen at Galerie S:t Petri from April 23 to May 5, 1981. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, a stamp poem was published by a Brazilian poet — but it was not until the 1960s that the stamp was used in a broader artistic context by the Fluxus artists. During the 1970s this form of art began to spread in a more consistent manner. Around the same time, another typically 1970s phenomenon within contemporary art developed: mail art — where artists send information to one another via postal systems. Thus, an international “underground” communication network was established. Stamp art and mail art have therefore often functioned side by side. Stamp art is a simple way of spreading ideas, slogans, drawings, and photographs. Artists, writers, and video artists work with stamps. Texts, portraits, birdsong — anything can be turned into a stamp. Like many new media, stamp art turns away from technical skill. What matters most is communication. Both mail art and stamp art seek to avoid the established, commercial art market. Galerie S:t Petri already presented in 1975 the first large group exhibition of artists’ stamps, featuring more than 300 participants. Hervé Fischer, French stamp artist, wrote that “the use of stamps is like tam-tam signals between different tribes. They speak of a very lively subculture with other values than those of contemporary society.” NON-COMMERCIAL ART LABORATORY FOUNDED IN 1971.

A sign’s cause is what signifies. Or rather, a sign’s cause is to explain.Because if we do not know everything, we must explain.Thus arises the story.The image is a tool for the handicapped — a comfort, even a healing one.To deny the image as a bearer of information is to deny the will to know, the root of knowledge.That we do not do.The sticky pot is the self-evidence of the overindulgent society; to deny this under prevailing circumstances is to remain naïve.The media producers’ cannibalism defends itself by the victims’ willingness and their worship of the polished surface. Certainly, one can detect a striving for neutrality.The relativistic theories of the fin-de-siècle created a game of uncertainty.One spoke of chains, processes, perhaps coincidences.One painted willingly empty spaces, gaps, white surfaces.Everything was simple.But the absence of Fontana, Reinhardt, Stella, etc. speaks volumes.“The emperor has no clothes,” cried the children.Yes, he has mixed together air and matter.Between Dada-realism’s concrete cut and Van der Velde’s opposites lies an ocean of thought, all summarized in:“I am not the self I seem to be.Always a slave, always the representative of an ideology that does not even recognize me as that which speaks of the discrepancy between myself and the world, where I am both the thief and the hero.”I am an antipoem. An ideology is born, it dies, it is created and destroyed.We find ourselves in a kind of middle ground.We no longer distance ourselves from these private and intimate regions of the artist, but find ourselves increasingly in the public realm.We use the sluggish, repetitive melody of the radio regulated by the night/day cycle.Through this, we do not answer the question of historical narrative, which is always labeled as unreliable.Our practice is more an attempt to find a method than a final answer.Let us speak, then, of a trailer, since its impact is minimal —because our practice is more an illustration than something definitive,because we (our work) still carry traces of bourgeois ego-(ethno)-centrism,because everything is still under examination.

We sat leaning back in the chairs, which were placed back to back in the middle of the large floor. There were many rows of seats with plastic covers that made our thighs and forearms sticky. We sat facing the large windows, which gave us a free view over the area outside. The windows covered the entire wall, stretching from floor to ceiling. Three numbered sliding doors led out. Through the windows we could see the parking area for the airplanes and a section of the taxiway itself.All the details quivered in the heat and the bright sunlight outside. We sat quietly without speaking to each other. Suddenly I stood up, hung the binoculars around my neck, and walked toward one of the doors in the glass wall. I stood there and looked out over the area for a moment before opening the door and stepping onto the warm, soft asphalt. The heat struck me like a blow. I closed the door behind me and cautiously walked diagonally across the tarmac. It suddenly seemed enormous, with its yellow and white signs and striped lines. When I had crossed over and walked down the slope toward the nearest taxiway, I looked around for the first time. The arrival hall lay behind me, low and small. The landscape was flat. Everything stretched straight out in front of me, across the taxiway; I could glimpse a few low ridges in the white sunlight. The taxiway consisted of concrete slabs laid together like a checkerboard. There were black marks on the runway from the airplanes’ rubber wheels. The curve of the runway made me unable to see the end of it. I raised the binoculars to my eyes and scanned the horizon. In the distance I saw the airplane coming.”","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:fccc62c730:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/sweden-today","title":"SWEDEN TODAY | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"JEAN SELLEM — SWEDEN TODAY — A THOUSAND AND ONE (BLACK) NIGHTS JEAN SELLEM SWEDEN TODAY A THOUSAND AND ONE (BLACK) NIGHTS 03–17.02.1981 Video document: During the exhibition Jean Sellem — Sweden Today (3–17 February 1981, Galerie S:t Petri), artist Oscar Reutersvärd spoke to a group of visitors.

In other situations, however, this interest may fairly be described as “total”. The kind of art actually produced by the modern state, rather than its control of the arts as such, together with the processes of its creation, has received far less attention. With this exhibition of Swedish State Art — i.e. art produced more or less directly by the state for the purpose of persuading its citizens to behave in one way rather than another — Galerie S:t Petri remedies this situation by placing it in a context of public debate from which it emerges. The degree to which State Art — whether in the form of traffic control signs, for example, or safety in places of work — impinges upon and provides our everyday environments is perhaps surprising. In many ways, it constitutes an unremarked and possibly uncritically accepted, more or less embracing, aspect of modern existence. This uncritical attitude to the quality and aesthetics of such an important feature of everyday existence no doubt stems from, and is supported by, a rather limited public concept of what constitutes art. In particular, the yet popular notion that art is limited to hanged (preferably painted) pictures in a gallery for the purpose of moral uplift, aesthetic enjoyment, instruction, sale, or the like. Perhaps something of an unholy blending of an educational institute, a church and a supermarket with aesthetic pretensions. The description of State Art as art requires little justification, since there is certainly nothing new in the usage of art form in an educative or persuasive context. Indeed, such usage may be related to the very origins of Western art. It has recently been suggested, for example, that the purpose of cave art, as it is known, was originally that of instruction in the art of hunting; while it is clear that a major interest of art in the European medieval period was the moral and spiritual redemption of medieval man. This is not to argue, of course, that art, or any other activity for the matter, must be purposeful, but rather the more obvious case that it can be so. If we would care to pursue the comparison, and contrast this modern product with that of the medieval period, it would perhaps become clear the differences lie, not only in the realm of aesthetics and the utilization of the superb technological possibilities of the modern world in relation to mass production, but that also the message has changed. Where the medieval European lived in a world that was dominated by the theme of spiritual salvation through moral action, we have moved to a world in which the message of physical survival tends to predominate. In the final resort, fear as such provides one important continuity in the production of State Art. If medieval citizens feared for their immortal souls, and modern counterparts fear for their physical survival, the process of the creation and structuring of fear as such through the medium of State Art obtains new interest. Fears may be great or small, real or trivial, extending from crayfish to atomic annihilation, but the attempt to organize such on a public basis appears ubiquitous. Indeed, the public organization of private anguish lies somewhere near the centre of the arts of the state itself. There seems little doubt that an exhibition of this nature may arouse many side interests which may range from the bureaucratic to the sociological, from the historical to the political, from aesthetics to techniques: but all this will have missed the central theme which we have attempted to illustrate with this exhibition. It is the process of the creation of pictures itself that deserves emphasis, and perhaps is usefully conceived as a process moving through three related stages, each of which is included in this exhibition. First, there is that of public chatter, particularly in the press, concerning a vast variety of issues and objects which could or should be the subject of public fears and attentions. Second, there exist or emerge interest organizations of various kinds, with their own flora of literature and pictures, having their aim in changes of state policy. Third, there are the picture produced by the institutions of the state itself which provide the real substance of State Art. Thus, as Wittgenstein expressed the matter so well, we talk, utter words, and only later get a picture of their life. Perhaps one final comment may be useful. In the modern democracies, the very process of the creation of State Art provides it with a certain ex post facto quality: that of preaching to the converted. It serves as an expression of public concerns and intentions, organizing and stabilizing such, rather than being the medium through which such are created. This is the essential difference to that of the totalitarian variety. D.E. Weston Lund, 1979 D.E. Weston was born in England, but has resided in Sweden for several years. He holds academic degrees in the philosophy of science and in the social sciences and has been a university lecturer at Lund since 1966.

The gallery is dark; inside, a lamp shaped like a rabbit glows, and a voice is heard from a tape recorder. Terry Berkowitz, who has not previously exhibited in Europe, began in 1972 to work with film, video, and conceptual art. Later she became involved with human behavior, sociology, and manipulations of reality. About the exhibition in Lund, Terry Berkowitz says:“Our fear is a manipulated and distorted reflection of our reality. Sometimes this fear remains unconscious. The things we imagine allow us to sublimate our real anxiety. In this exhibition, a personal experience that continually returned in my childhood nights is manifested. By presenting an image, my own specific distortions are communicated to someone else — a transfer of realities takes place — and the viewer re-experiences his or her own early experiences. By repeating someone else’s experience of anxiety, it becomes possible to discover previously unknown information, which perhaps leads one to come to terms with one’s own anxiety-filled past.” The exhibition is open weekdays from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:968d9d2ee7:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/thomas-niggl","title":"THOMAS NIGGL | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"THOMAS NIGGL — SCHWEDISCHE GESICHTER — 16.09 - 22.09.1976 THOMAS NIGGLSCHWEDISCHE GESICHTER16.09 - 22.09.1976 Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5Lund – Sweden046 / 14 78 00 THOMAS NIGGL from West Germany presents from 16–22 September 1976 a “painting” at Galerie S:t Petri consisting of many small parts that together form a whole.The exhibition is titled Schwedische Gesichter (Swedish Faces), referring to Swedish conditions. The artist works from certain basic materials — food, water, and a TV set — and with the help of these components builds images in the exhibition space.During the first three days, Thomas Niggl himself will create the material.After that, visitors will be able to experience the relics. For many years, Niggl has worked with action art and painting.Originally from West Germany, he has in recent years also lived in Holland, Scandinavia, and Mexico, participating in various cultural contexts.In 1969, he began publishing books, pamphlets, and small prints under the publishing name Omnibus News.The goal of the edition is to build an international family, an independent, international information system.Alongside these activities, Thomas Niggl is also engaged in architectural projects. “In art, I liberate myself,” says Niggl, “and perhaps, in a certain sense, can thereby lead others toward liberation.” Thomas Niggl sees his paintings primarily as experiments.Sometimes they can be regarded as practical philosophy. “The paintings are states (Zustand) — nothing completed, yet not a process either, but rather something emphasized through action.” Eroticism, in a broad and vital sense, plays an important role in his work.He believes that this may be the main motive for all creation.Eroticism can be described as radiation, complex emotion, tension between people — but also between an image and a person.In this process, both artist and viewer are engaged in the act of creation. The exhibition in Lund is his first solo exhibition in Sweden.At Galerie S:t Petri, however, he has previously taken part in an “event” in Christmas 1975, together with Mette Aarre and the sheep.

Some of Adriani’s earlier canvases in this exhibition are landscape impressions built as coloristic play, with lyrically shimmering pure color patches applied with broad brushstrokes, in a manner that finds its closest counterparts in certain divisionist, fragmented canvases by Derain, Vlaminck and Braque, and within the Fauvist circles of 1905–07.</p><p>But Adriani has not been content merely to connect to an early abstract tradition. He is a fresh, exploratory artist who, in the few years he has been active, has already managed to develop a highly personal, purely abstract painting characterised by an unusually lyrical feeling for color. In his most recent canvases he seems ready to leave this style behind in favour of a design language in which natural elements once again reappear, abstracted into large, unified magical figures.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-right\\\">Knut Andersson</p><p><br></p>\", \"text_fr\": \"Sandro Adriani\\nFace à la peinture de Sandro Adriani, on se rappelle à quel point les racines de notre art abstrait contemporain sont profondes. Ce qui apparaît si frais et si nouveau dans ses toiles est paradoxalement précisément ce qui relève du passé. Il se tient avec une grande liberté par rapport à la plupart de ce qui est considéré comme actuel dans l’art contemporain, et s’inscrit au contraire dans une tradition en contact direct avec les sources de l’art abstrait moderne — les années héroïques de percée juste avant et pendant la Première Guerre mondiale.\\n\\nCe point de départ pour un jeune artiste est, bien que surprenant, tout à fait naturel : son professeur a été le désormais âgé artiste italien Gerardo Dottori, membre du cercle futuriste, proche ami de Severini, Balla et d’autres dont les noms sont bien connus en Suède pour leur rôle dans les années de percée du modernisme italien et comme signataires des manifestes célèbres.\\n\\nC’est certainement grâce aux enseignements de Dottori qu’Adriani a pu, de manière très directe, renouer avec les premières expérimentations du début du XXe siècle — en puisant son inspiration chez des pionniers tels que Monet, Van Gogh et Signac pour créer une peinture coloriste où les impressions de la nature sont abstraites jusqu’à devenir presque totalement non figuratives. Certaines des toiles plus anciennes d’Adriani présentées dans cette exposition sont des impressions de paysages construites comme un jeu coloriste, avec des touches de couleurs pures, lyriques et scintillantes, appliquées au large pinceau, d’une manière qui trouve ses équivalents les plus proches dans certaines toiles divisionnistes et fragmentées de Derain, Vlaminck et Braque, ainsi que dans les cercles fauves des années 1905–07.\\n\\nMais Adriani ne s’est pas contenté de renouer avec une tradition abstraite précoce. Il est un artiste curieux et expérimental qui, en quelques années d’activité, a déjà réussi à développer une peinture abstraite très personnelle, marquée par une sensibilité lyrique inhabituelle à la couleur. Dans ses toiles les plus récentes, il semble prêt à quitter ce style pour une forme d’expression dans laquelle les éléments naturels réapparaissent, à nouveau abstraits en grandes figures magiques unifiées.\\n\\nKnut Andersson\", \"text_de\": \"Sandro Adriani\\nWenn man vor der Malerei von Sandro Adriani steht, wird man daran erinnert, wie tief die Wurzeln unserer zeitgenössischen abstrakten Kunst reichen. Was in seinen Leinwänden so frisch und neu erscheint, ist paradoxerweise gerade das, was alt ist. Er steht in großer Freiheit gegenüber vielem, was heute als zeitgenössisch relevant gilt, und knüpft stattdessen an eine Tradition an, die in direktem Kontakt mit den Ursprüngen der modernen abstrakten Kunst steht – den heroischen Durchbruchsjahren unmittelbar vor und während des Ersten Weltkriegs.\\n\\nDieser Ausgangspunkt für einen jungen Künstler ist, so überraschend er scheinen mag, dennoch vollkommen natürlich: Sein Lehrer war der mittlerweile ergraute italienische Künstler Gerardo Dottori, Mitglied des futuristischen Kreises, ein enger Freund von Severini, Balla und anderen, deren Namen in Schweden als bedeutende Vertreter der italienischen Moderne und als Unterzeichner der berühmten Manifeste gut bekannt sind.\\n\\nSicherlich verdankt Adriani es den Lehren Dottoris, dass er auf sehr direkte Weise an die frühen Experimente zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts anknüpfen konnte – inspiriert von Pionieren wie Monet, van Gogh und Signac, um eine koloristische Malerei zu schaffen, in der Natureindrücke zu nahezu rein ungegenständlichen Formen abstrahiert werden. Einige von Adrianis früheren Leinwänden in dieser Ausstellung sind Landschaftsimpressionen, aufgebaut als koloristisches Spiel aus lyrisch schimmernden reinen Farbtönen, mit breitem Pinsel aufgetragen, in einer Weise, die ihre nächsten Parallelen in bestimmten divisionistischen, fragmentierten Leinwänden von Derain, Vlaminck und Braque sowie in den fauvistischen Kreisen der Jahre 1905–07 findet.\\n\\nDoch Adriani hat sich nicht damit zufriedengegeben, lediglich an eine frühe abstrakte Tradition anzuknüpfen. Er ist ein neugierig forschender Künstler, der in den wenigen Jahren seines bisherigen Schaffens bereits eine sehr persönliche, rein abstrakte Malerei entwickelt hat, geprägt von einem ungewöhnlich lyrischen Farbgefühl. In seinen jüngsten Leinwänden scheint er diese Stilrichtung zugunsten einer Formensprache zu verlassen, in der Naturelemente erneut erscheinen – abstrahiert zu großen, geschlossenen magischen Figurationen.\\n\\nKnut Andersson\", \"media\": \"\", \"mediaCaption\": \"\" }, { \"img\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rphl66/archive-jeansellem/main/1971/1971-sandro-adriani/originals/sandro-adriani-2.jpg\", \"caption\": \"\", \"cat\": \"coverage\", \"text\": \"<h3>Galerie S:t Petri</h3><p>S:t Petri Kyrkogata 5.

The play lasts exactly one hour and is performed several times a day. “Lineout” is based partly on deliberate choice, partly on pure chance. Within each segment there are thirteen performances, each with up to four possible “lineout” variations.Each lineout includes two participants, a piece of coloured rope, and a player. The length and direction of each lineout are determined by a random method.The result of each performance becomes a separate sculpture. Various aspects of “Words, Actions and Situations” have been presented in theatres, galleries, streets and parks in England, Holland and Belgium.Now, for the first time, the Swedish audience will become acquainted with this theatre/sculpture group. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, February 4–6, 1975, Jan and Tony Costa will perform at Stortorget between 11:00 and 14:00.They can also be met at Galerie S:t Petri on the same days between 15:00 and 20:00.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:6372091e89:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/tra","title":"TRA | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"TRA — 21.02-07.03.1979 TRA21.02-07.03.1979 In today’s Italy, constant ideological debates are taking place. Political tensions run high. We can read about them in the newspapers and hear about them on radio and television. Naturally, Italian artists have also been drawn into these discussions regarding the permanence of the current social order compared with other systems that might be considered better. A glimpse of this issue can be seen in the three current exhibitions at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund. Fernando De Filippi, Nicole Gravier, and the magazine TRA from Italy present their views on the artist’s role in a society such as the Italian one. One of the main goals for artists, according to them, is to be able to feel part of a collective unit. To achieve this, one must understand the ideological conditions of the country and take a position either for or against them. The artist should avoid isolation, avoid placing themselves outside of reality and social interaction. Otherwise, there is a risk of being forced into acting within boundaries where art itself becomes purely ornamental. In one issue of TRA, the theme “Art as Ideology” is discussed. It states, among other things, that humanity needs alternative models to those currently existing within a given system. There must always be the possibility of revising any system — whether in the East or the West. For De Filippi, Gravier, and TRA, the current Italian social system is of such a nature that it must be questioned. Fernando De Filippi works with language in the form of slogans borrowed from texts related to art and politics. He places these various slogans everywhere — in subways, on squares, and in public spaces. He uses different languages simultaneously and sets them in contexts where their original meaning sometimes becomes its opposite. Nicole Gravier is primarily concerned with mapping myths and clichés in art and television. She creates series of color images of phenomena from both fields to highlight their “sacredness.” TRA, the magazine, focuses mainly on placing art within a social and societal perspective. Its emphasis on the collective often comes at the expense of the individual. For this reason, it also welcomes viewpoints from scientists in various social-scientific disciplines.

In some way, the human being has created his own likeness in the car.Nature is transformed by man into a car, which then in turn seeks to reunite itself with nature. The car lives its own life, in part quite similar to that of a human. When new, it is caressed with foaming shampoo and soft cloths, polished and admired with proud eyes. After its short service to humankind, it is perhaps removed to one of the huge car cemeteries, or abandoned in a forest clearing. There is something hopeless and beautiful about these cars, which are slowly swallowed up by nature. Grass and flowers penetrate the damaged parts, shrubbery grips the steering wheel. Car graveyards are perhaps the most expressive monuments of our time. To wander among them is like experiencing a vanished culture, while being in the midst of it. The desolation and timeless atmosphere surrounding these cars makes us unaware that this is only a generation’s work. What humanity once, at the dawn of technology, acclaimed and felt proud of, now lies in great heaps as a burden to our conscience. The car, which has come to man as a plague, an insect, a fossil.A chrome bastard with heart and nervous system.An invention of man – man’s own creation – which long ago left him lost and irrational behind it.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:ae43a81213:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/ulises-carrion","title":"ULISES CARRIÓN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"ULISES CARRIÓN — MAIL ART AND — THE BIG MONSTER ULISES CARRIÓNMAIL ART ANDTHE BIG MONSTERTWO LECTURES / PERFORMANCES14.02-15.02.1979 Ulises Carrión from Mexico — who has for several years lived and worked in Holland — visits Galerie S:t Petri in Lund on Wednesday, February 14, and Thursday, February 15, 1979.He will give two lectures on Mail Art, and will also present his new project E.A.M.I.S (Erratic Art Mail International System). About eight years ago, Ulises Carrión founded a center for artists’ books in Amsterdam. During that period, many artists who worked experimentally and in an avant-garde spirit began using the book as a means of expression. The book became an artwork. The artist/author was often involved in the production process and could therefore constantly reshape their ideas and images. Three or four years ago, Galerie S:t Petri presented an exhibition with several of the books produced at Other Books and So (as the book workshop was called). It was the first time that artists’ books were shown in Sweden. For Ulises Carrión, this type of activity now belongs to the past. About a year ago, he closed Other Books and So and now devotes himself to building an archive around that earlier work.He also works with Mail Art and is attempting to create a new international postal system that would exist outside conventional national postal systems.By using this alternative artistic mail network, he hopes to strengthen the international art community. EAMIS will have its own stamps and postmarks. It represents an evolution of the artistic phenomenon known as Mail Art — that is, artistic messages sent through the postal system. During his two-day visit, Ulises Carrión will give a presentation on the Mail Art phenomenon from a social and cultural perspective.This will take place on Wednesday, February 14, at 8 p.m.The following day — Thursday, February 15, at 8 p.m. — he will introduce his new project Erratic Art Mail International System.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:4d6939b6c9:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/unlimited-expression","title":"UNLIMITED EXPRESSION | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"UNLIMITED EXPRESSION — SEPTEMBER - OCTOBER 1980 UNLIMITED EXPRESSIONSEPTEMBER - OCTOBER 1980 Call for Innovators! Galerie S:t Petri in Lund invites all creative individuals—those who see themselves as innovators and trailblazers—to participate in an exploratory manifestation titled “Unlimited Expression.” After nine years of experimental artistic and cultural activity, S:t Petri wishes to explore the possibilities of creating a forum for innovators in various fields such as art, music, poetry, science, and technology. The experiment is therefore an attempt to discover new forms of expression. At the same time, it marks a farewell to the avant-gardism of the 1970s in art, which has unfortunately been increasingly exploited by certain art dealers, institutions, and so-called alternative publishers. To maintain a certain freedom of action, the manifestation is not limited by time. The hope is to create an experimental and creative environment in a city that offers both favorable conditions and expertise. All who consider themselves carriers of new ideas—such as inventors, philosophers, and independent thinkers—are welcome to participate in this unique manifestation. Galerie S:t Petri is open weekdays 3–8 p.m., Saturdays 1–5 p.m. Text extracted from the poster: UNLIMITED EXPRESSION — A Promontory Art Manifestation for the Eighties Since 1971 the experimental, non-commercial art laboratory Galerie S:t Petri in Lund, Sweden, has been carrying out research and project work in the fields of contemporary art and philosophy. Many different facets of thought and expression have been explored extensively and in depth during the gallery’s nine years of existence. In accordance with its interest in experimental developments outside the more commercial circuits of the art world, Jean Sellem of S:t Petri considered the beginning of the eighties as an opportune time for a brief analysis of contemporary art, mass culture, poetry and science through the means of a “manifestation of art” that once again regarded humanism as priority over what is becoming the new metaphysics or psychology. Pressed by a growing crisis in Western art and thought, this attempt was aimed to dissolve the norms the sixties began gradually building up to become the dogmas of the seventies. Participants in the manifestation came from Sweden and abroad to express both their own ideas about form itself and the participants’. Each had separate, working divisions within the gallery, and they were given total freedom to express their thoughts and ideas through painting, construction, sculpture, installations, music, video, philosophy, metaphysics, and science. No restrictions, deadlines, or censorship were applied; nor was any control exercised over aesthetic form, language, or concept. The experiment was open-ended. Each participant developed his or her own characteristic approach. Some worked with language structures, others with scientific symbolism. Among the visual contributors were artists such as Andrzej Płoski, Erik Dietman, and Rudolf Steiner’s spiritual successors, whose works reflected the metaphysical dimensions of light and transformation. Others, working in physics or mathematics, provided models expressing energy fields or philosophical systems too broad in a time perspective for the human eye to follow. A similar reflection of metamorphosis was expressed in a pictorial review using new digital grids. A subtle ordinary change of phases could bridge the physical and personality aspects over time and transform body and thought as an ontological chart of new life and death. Furthermore, an astrological frame of reference was drawn for the question of the role of chaos, determination, and freedom in our lives. A wide range of human expression found its infinite correlation to muscle movements possible here as another contribution. A mathematical equation was displayed showing how one quantity can be constructed but at the same time conserving the energy of the individual. With the help of white sheets suspended in space, a group of schoolboys created a labyrinth in which one of them, giving the vibration to the hanging motor of a fan, gave life. The anthroposophic thoughts of Rudolf Steiner were also presented as pieces combined of scientific knowledge emphasizing ideology and creativity. Metaphysics was understood through the relationship of form, light, and philosophy; a model of thinking in terms of non-logical, non-symbolic constructs that was visually abstract. A large series of drawings, each of the same height, which meant that more forms of expression could easily relate to each other, was made possible by horizontal walls, flat surfaces, and easy contact between contributors. Each of these expressions reflected not merely rational attitudes, but also spontaneity and inner necessity. The project thus became a laboratory for intuition and transcendence—a platform where art could again redefine its philosophical and moral role in a humanistic context. All of the participants presented their works anonymously—none signed their contributions. This anonymity was crucial, ensuring that no hierarchy of artistic value or name recognition was established. Each participant, through their contribution, expressed their own insight into the unity of art and life. A translation of the text published in the local newspaper follows: “Galerie S:t Petri in Lund challenges and encourages all creative persons to consider themselves as innovators and ‘innovative thinkers’ and to take part in an experimental manifestation called Unlimited Expression.” “After nine years of experimental artistic and cultural activity, S:t Petri wishes to investigate the possibilities of creating a forum for innovators in various fields such as art, music, poetry, science, and technology.” “The experiment is therefore an attempt to discover new forms of expression. At the same time, it marks a farewell to the avant-gardism of the 1970s, which has unfortunately been increasingly exploited by certain art dealers, institutions, and alternative publishing houses.” “The aim is to create a platform for intellectual and spiritual freedom that transcends both political and commercial constraints.” “Everyone who believes themselves to be a bearer of new ideas—particularly inventors, philosophers, and independent thinkers—is welcome to participate in this unique experiment.” Marie Sjöberg, S:t Petri Archive of Experimental and Marginal Art, Lund, Sweden September/October 1980","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:774ee1954b:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/ursula-reuter-christiansen","title":"URSULA REUTER CHRISTIANSEN | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"URSULA REUTER CHRISTIANSEN — POETISKE DRAGTER — 08- 20.11.1974 URSULA REUTER CHRISTIANSENPOETISKE DRAGTER08- 20.11.1974 Galerie S:t PetriS:t Petri Kyrkogata 5, Fack 7, 22101 Lund, Sweden — Tel. 046-14 78 00 Ursula Reuter shows paintings for the first time in Swedenat Galerie S:t Petri, Lund, from November 8 to 20. She paints primarily images concerning the woman and the worker. “Both woman and worker must be liberated. Both, bowed under slavery, must reach out to one another and make a new language accessible to us.” (Saint-Simon) Ursula Reuter was born in 1943 in Trier, Germany. For four years, from 1965 to 1969, she attended the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts under the direction of Joseph Beuys. In 1965 she left Germany and settled in Denmark, where, as a woman, one could work more freely than in Germany. Ursula Reuter believes that the artist can influence our “shared consciousness” through images and symbols and through actions that, guided by the unconscious, can work towards a more humane and liberated direction. Thus she often “illustrates” poems — among others, by the Danish poet Eske K. Mathiesen — by identifying with the person described in the poem and giving it form through poetic dress. In this way she pays tribute to the underprivileged — the court jester, the gypsy girl, the worker. Three women often reappear in her paintings — Rosa Luxemburg, Klara Zetkin, and Alexandra Kollontai — either together or separately. At the Lund exhibition, a portrait of Lenin with the Småland forests behind him will also be shown. This image originated after a stay in Småland in the summer of 1974. “One day Lenin sat by one of those stone fences and freed the Swedish serfs from their stone enclosures!” Besides painting, Ursula Reuter also works with film. Her latest, “The Redeemer,” was shown at the International Film Festival for Young Filmmakers in Berlin in June 1974. The film is a musical legend about woman’s oppression and emancipation. Ursula Reuter’s husband Henning Christiansen composed the music for the film. Last year, Ursula Reuter collaborated with Lene Adler Petersen and Elisabeth Therkelsen on the film “Three Women and a Pig.” She has also participated in the collective film “The Research.” At present, she is working on a radio program about, among others, Rosa Luxemburg.

At the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, both Professor Vilhelm Lundstrøm and Professor Aksel Jørgensen were of great importance to her. She has worked as a painter, but from the beginning it has been graphic problems that have mainly occupied her. The possibilities of woodcutting for working with elementary graphic effects gave nourishment to her imagination. She regards herself fundamentally as a lithographer. For some years now, however, she has also worked with collages, which have received much attention, even though they originally arose only as by-products to help her see the finished lithograph. In a contemporary visual language, Vera Myhre has sought to interpret her experiences of everyday life as it takes shape: where people move about, in the station waiting hall, at pedestrian crossings, on a bench reading a newspaper, etc. She has held numerous exhibitions over the years, among others at the Riverside Museum in New York, Cottingham Gardens in London, Wolfgang Gurlitt Museum in Linz, Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris, as well as, of course, in various places in Scandinavia.

But for various reasons, one does not always have the right means to reach this mysterious source. Art is a path to life, he also believes. So are philosophy and science. But he sees the artist, the philosopher, and the scientist as thinkers who go to the root of an idea and not as narrow specialists dependent on a time-bound way of thinking and acting. Wacław Ropiecki emphasizes the importance of constantly devoting oneself to self-study, reflection, and introspection in order to discover, or rather rediscover (remember), phenomena that already exist. For about a decade he has taken pictures of himself in various contexts — in military service, while travelling somewhere, together with friends. In the beginning, art became for him a path to self-therapy. He must try to reconnect the relationship between himself and life. Wacław Ropiecki wants to come away from the fragmented self. He wants to restore to the human being the possibility to live with truth, knowledge of life. There is no clear answer to what love, art, or religion actually is, he believes. These are constantly changing processes in which humans participate.

During this time, the people of Lund and other art-interested visitors will have the opportunity to become acquainted with the International Non-Violence Party (IP), founded by him together with Barbro Carlman, an international political party established on May 1, 1972. IP seeks to stimulate an awareness that perceives the innermost connections and, in accordance with them, takes responsibility for the consequences of one’s way of life. In its program IP states, among other things: “We believe that Western slaughterhouse cultures are based on a development-fixated idea founded on a myth — the myth that everything exists to serve humanity’s egocentric purposes, that her environment can be isolated until it becomes a sterile, ‘human-friendly’ Eden in a glass dome. This comfortable dream can never come true, since human beings live in an inseparable symbiosis with all living things on earth. … We, who founded IP, live in and with art that strives toward non-violence. … We want no compulsion in our views or ways of life; we want to stimulate independent, prejudice-free thinking that in its own rhythm facilitates the emergence of the awareness that gives us both joy and the ability to take responsibility for ourselves…” Several prominent people have over the years praised Brenner — among them August Strindberg, who in a letter to a colleague wrote: “This is the new era’s man! Brenner has found la nouvelle formule! You know that I used to end all my letters to literary friends with ‘Read Nietzsche!’ ” Brenner, like Nietzsche, rejected the dualism between good and evil. He is “beyond Good and Evil,” but he has drawn different and more radical conclusions. The core of art is love, non-violence. Reverence for the ethics of life’s recognition has its relative ethics. Good is only that which preserves and promotes life, and everything that harms or destroys life is evil. The ethics of devotion must unite with the ethics of self-perfection (cf. Nietzsche); they must become universal and allow devotion to apply not only to humankind but to all that exists, all created beings, all life. Therefore: read William Blake, read Van Gogh’s letters, read Brenner!

They are necessary for the biological balance, and thereby for human survival. 250 million birds destroy in a single month as many harmful insects as would weigh at least as much as 50,675 Volkswagen cars. BIRD MURDER IS HUMAN MURDER Instead of birds, man uses tons of insecticides for pest control, which are sprayed out and in turn make their way through the food chain into the human body, causing harm. “PEOPLE OF CENTRAL AND NORTHERN EUROPE WHO WANT TO HEAR THEIR BIRDS SING: HELP US.” With this cry for help, environmentally conscious Italians express their desperate struggle against the mass extermination of European migratory birds. Contrary to the deliberate falsifications spread, for instance, by travel agencies, the extermination continues in Italy at a cruel pace: 250 million migratory birds are killed every year, often without a hunting license. This takes place through shooting, netting, lime traps, and snares, especially in southern Italy down to Sicily (except Bozen). The Bird Observatory in Radolfzell reports a CATASTROPHIC DECLINE OF EUROPEAN MIGRATORY BIRDS, many of which are now extinct. These murdered birds are not eaten by the poor but end up as delicacies in the mouths of the wealthy. A bird weighing 4–5 grams, such as a robin, becomes a meal for a glutton. In just one month, these annihilated birds could have destroyed at least 37,500,000 kg of harmful insects (equal to 50,675 Volkswagen cars) and saved agriculture from enormous damage. As a replacement, chemical insecticides are used — which means: MURDER OF HUMANS THROUGH POISONOUS FOOD OR STARVATION, when trillions of non-poisonous insects destroy crops. “SAVE OUR MIGRATORY BIRDS!” Nowadays, even small children take part in bird hunting, using toy pistols (especially against robins). The magazine Diana reported that from a single railway station in Foggia, transports included 28,563 kg of dead and 8,680 kg of live birds. The living ones, intended as “decoys,” are caught with broken wings and legs, blinded, or have their eyelids sewn shut, transformed into living toys, kept in dark basements and tiny cages. Up to 52,000 decoy birds are annually sold on the market in Northern Italy. Their helpless cries, which express pain and fear, are used to lure other birds to their death during spring migration. Other decoy birds are hung by their tails or broken legs, with their heads facing downwards, until they die screaming. Thus, humankind mistreats its irreplaceable allies — beings without whom it cannot survive. If you do not want to be counted among the irresponsible, help by: explaining these environmentally destructive conditions to your acquaintances; signing petitions against the killing of birds to be sent to the governments of the EEC countries, tourist agencies, and the ADAC (German automobile club); sending personal protest letters to the following addresses: Director General of the EEC Commission Department of Environmental Affairs Rue de la Loi 200 B-1040 Brussels Italian Embassy Strandvägen 7B 114 56 Stockholm The Pope in Rome Director General V.

Support the COMMITTEE AGAINST BIRD MURDER (Komitee gegen den Vogelmord), in cooperation with the German Animal Protection Federation (Deutscher Tierschutz). Committee’s address: Komitee gegen den Vogelmord c/o Dr. Renate Reitler D-521 Bielefeld West Germany The committee has branches in the following cities: Augsburg, Hamburg, Mannheim, Munich, Osnabrück, and Berlin. It is in contact with the following international organizations: Landesliga gegen die Vernichtung der Vögel, Florence Internationale Anti-Jagdkomitee, Turin Stiftung Mondial Alternatief, “International Action – Stop Mass Bird Murder,” Zandvoord, Netherlands. Organized Mass Murder of Migratory Birds is War Against Humanity and Nature According to scientific research by the bird station in Radolfzell, the number of our migratory birds has decreased by between 50% and 88% (Max Planck Society Report, March 21, 1973). Different species are facing extinction. Despite this, the mass extermination of migratory birds continues in Italy. Just as in Caesar’s time when “res nullius” (“no one’s property”) was killed — everything that crawled or flew — so it is today! In contrast to the decline in migratory birds, the number of hunters increases every year: 1960 – 800,000 hunters 1970 – 1,600,000 hunters 1971 – 1,800,000 hunters 1972 – 2,000,000 hunters There are 400,000 bird trappers, “uccellatori,” who, with various nets, lime traps, mirrors, and whistles, lure migratory birds. Of these, 3,600 licensed trappers (many of them well-known politicians) use so-called “roccoli.” In these trap fields, entire flocks are captured as they fly over the Alps. About 300,000 bird catchers practice the sadistic art of making captured birds sing — the so-called “zimbelli” (decoy birds). “When the small finches are fully grown, they are trained to attract their own kind. This is done by blinding them. The bird’s eyes are pierced with a red-hot needle (or sharp wire). The eyelids are then burned and sealed, and the bird can only sing when it has lost its sight.” — From L’arte dell’andar per uccelli con vischio, by Amadeo Giacomini (1969) According to La Stampa (Turin, December 15, 1972), there are not only these licensed trappers but also a very high number of illegal poachers. According to the association Libera Caccia (“Free Hunt”), Italian hunters and poachers fire 840 shots per person per year. Every year, 512 million cartridges are discharged in Italy. At a cost of 50 lire per cartridge, this amounts to 75 billion lire (approx. 472 million kronor). The Italian newspapers Epoca and Natura e Civiltà reported on November 9, 1972, that the number of bird traps has doubled in recent years. The increase in hunters is due in part to Italy’s growing prosperity, which allows many to afford weapons, cars, and licenses. But it is also the result of a “last-minute rush” — birds are becoming scarce, and hunters wish to prove their “manhood” once more. Hunting in Italy cannot be compared to that in our countries. Every hunter has the right to shoot within a 100-meter radius of houses, roads, and paths, meaning homes and gardens are surrounded by a deadly zone at least 180 meters wide. According to reports from Italy’s largest arms manufacturers (in Brescia), there were 1.5 million hunters in 1971, equipped with modern weapons — mostly semi-automatic shotguns. In addition, many small-caliber weapons (“spingardi”) are in use. Italy has the longest hunting season in the world; it begins in the last week of August and lasts for migratory birds until March 31 — in some southern regions until the end of May. The number of hunters exceeds the total armed forces of NATO in Europe. Having nearly exterminated its native wildlife, Italy imports 12.6 million kronor’s worth of game annually to shoot immediately. Since the local game is depleted on the first hunting days, hunters then turn to the migratory birds arriving from the north, seeking refuge in their home territories. Bird trapping is carried out partly with expensive 400-meter-long nylon nets in which birds become entangled. They are pulled from the meshes, often losing their feet, wings, or heads in the process. The luckiest die from strangulation. In the region of Friuli–Venezia Giulia, there are 1,274 bird-trapping centers in operation. In Trentino–Alto Adige, there are 4,000 hunting huts. On a 10 km stretch in the Etsch Valley alone, 388 hunting blinds create such dense barriers that only a few birds survive. In 1970, the Lega Nazionale contro la Distruzione degli Uccelli (“National League Against the Extermination of Birds”) and the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera collected 500,000 protest signatures against bird murder. On October 25, 1972, Count Elio Carlo Ferrero, president of the Comitato Internazionale Anticaccia (International Anti-Hunting Committee) in Turin, handed over to the Italian government more than one million travel boycott signatures from across Europe. Arms factories, ammunition industries, hunting-equipment manufacturers, canned meat producers, and corrupt politicians (many of them avid hunters) prevent the enforcement of even the most minimal protective regulations for migratory birds. The Italian government remains deaf to worldwide protests. The continued bird slaughter in Italy ultimately means the downfall of European and African fauna. Only measures that impact Italy’s economy can compel the government to end this war against nature. KOMITEE GEGEN DEN VOGELMORD – KOMMITTÉN MOT FÅGELMORD (The above text is a translation of a German brochure.) IS THIS ART – OR THE ART OF EXTINCTION? Three hundred species of animals, birds, and fish have been eliminated by civilized man in the past 250 years. These are now permanently extinct. Another thousand species are now in immediate danger of total extinction. In recent years, modern industrial civilization, by emitting into the air, the ozone layer, into the bodies of animals and man, and into the world’s water tables, has dangerously affected the balance of nature. We do not have enough scientific knowledge either to monitor or control the damage we are doing to our world. The wanton killing of birds and animals for killing’s sake still continues. For example, in Italy, it is estimated that 250 million migrating birds are trapped and killed needlessly each year. Unfortunately, in this case, this destruction of bird life is blessed by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy.

On Friday, April 14 at 3 p.m., he will perform an action.In addition, the exhibition — in a Dadaist spirit — provides information on the many different activities Yoshio Nakajima has been involved in to create his own world since he entered the sphere of art more than twenty years ago. For Yoshio Nakajima, the action / happening is a vital necessity.This artistic medium makes it possible for human beings to open their emotional world.Above all, it is we — who live in a cultural climate where emotion and spontaneity have been replaced by emotional coldness and efficiency — who need this form of liberation art. His work seeks to express humanity as a whole.He creates objects and performs actions / happenings where politics, life, death, and love intertwine — where man’s inner world confronts external “reality.”The collisions that arise can, for example, take the form of an action / happening. Yoshio Nakajima does not believe in stagnation.Tomorrow he may very well have changed his art, but what he emphasizes is that humanity must continually and daily seek new possibilities for international communication. He regards the action / happening as perhaps one of the most important ways to open people up — to provoke some form of reaction.Among his most notable happenings are “Ecology in Tokyo,” “Harakiri Happening,” and “Torture and Persecution of Political Prisoners.” During his visit to the Soviet Union, he greatly surprised the Russians in Moscow. However, since the happening there was regarded as a “decadent capitalist phenomenon,” his work was instead referred to as an “ancient Japanese dance.” The exhibition is open on weekdays from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., and on Saturdays and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:e9ca85e445:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/yumiko-kodama","title":"YUMIKO KODAMA | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"YUMIKO — INTERNATIONAL ART SYMPOSIUM — 17.05-08.07.1976 YUMIKOINTERNATIONAL ART SYMPOSIUM17.05-08.07.1976 12 m X 5 m15 tonsLaunched in Lake Immeln ( Sweden) April 27 , 1976 ( Three big tents, formerly serving as military hospitals, are available for the symposium) A film about the ideas behind YUMIKO at Lake Immeln is being shown in Galerie S:t Petri April 27, 1976, 6.00 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"},{"id":"u:4767a42b5f:popup","url":"https://www.raphaelleonardlevy.com/jeansellem/yumiko-kodama-1978","title":"YUMIKO KODAMA | Raphaël Léonard Lévy","content":"YUMIKO KODAMA — TEA CEREMONY (STRAIGHT LINE) — 14.12 - 17.12.1978 YUMIKO KODAMATEA CEREMONY (STRAIGHT LINE)14.12 - 17.12.1978 YUMIKO KODAMA from Japan is currently visiting Europe.This is the first time she is showing her work outside Japan.Her exhibition Straight Line at Galerie S:t Petri in Lund takes place between 14 and 17 December 1978. Yumiko Kodama’s works are at once avant-garde and traditional — traditional through classical technical methods and materials, avant-garde in their visual and conceptual expression.Her works have often emerged through Yoga and Zen. She does not really distinguish between her art and herself as a person, but regards them as a unity.Straight Line is for her the total expression of herself. Through both traditional and modern ceremonies, Yumiko Kodama expresses herself.In connection with the exhibition at Galerie S:t Petri, on Thursday at 1 p.m., she will demonstrate the traditional Japanese tea ceremony and offer green tea, which has a thousand-year-old tradition.

The critics Carlo Bertocci, Fulvio Salvadori, and Pier Luigi Tazzi are also participating. The first and last of these have selected the works presented in Lund. The exhibition consists of three parts: Documentation of Zona’s activities from its founding in 1975 up to the present, in the form of postcards, books, catalogues, and photographs. One work by each artist, where every piece is independently created and reflects the temporal shift from Zona to Lund. Personal documentation sent by individual participants to accompany the exhibition. “It is not easy to explain our intentions in a few words,” says Giuseppe Chiari.“It is about believing or not believing in art as something ‘pure’, about believing or not believing in the primacy of certain forms of language. What matters, I think, is not to believe in the perfect — the only correct language. Perfection can mean a lack of movement. The perfect easily leads to the divine.Life, on the other hand, is imprecise and continuous.” Chiari therefore names his music Musica Madre (“Mother Music”) instead of Musica Padre (“Father Music”), as the mother — or woman — represents continuity of existence, transformation, and flexibility, whereas the father stands for fixed continuity, obedience, and what is already defined. Another viewpoint shared by the exhibiting artists is that art is work, and that this means everything. “Work is art because it belongs to humanity,” says Alberto Moretti. When there is a loving relationship between the artist and their work, that work becomes art. Thought and action must follow one another, not be separated. The constant striving to seek knowledge, to test reality, and not to stop at what is already known is essential. The diversity of opinions and forms of expression — photography, film, books, text, and much more — is of great importance to these artists. The exhibition is open weekdays from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.","tags":["popup","jeansellem"],"section":"popup"}];
